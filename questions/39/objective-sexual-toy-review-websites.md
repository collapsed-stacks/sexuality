Are there any good websites one can rely on providing objective review of sexual toys? Obviously one could try going onto various sex shop website and see what items are promoted or have good reviews, but those might be biased (store wanting to sell the expensive, gimmicky items, rather than the good ones), or subjective (someone's initial reaction to the toy purchased).
