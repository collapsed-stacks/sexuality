Almost 3 years ago my wife and i began using vibrators to stimulate her clitoris while we have intercourse. Sex "quality" with those toys is great, but after some time it seems as if we need more powerful or intense toys for her to reach climax.

Is there any risk to get "addicted" to these toys to the point where sex without them can become "boring"?

As for physical sensation there is no proof that this would cause any permanent desensitation of her clitoris. ([Source](http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/3757.html))

If you feel that the increasing demand on power and intensity is becoming too high just back off for a while, stop using toys or use significantly lower power. This might be frustrating but quickly increases sensitivity again.
