I have read a lot of texts about female ejaculation but I have yet to find any conclusion on what the fluid is, where it comes from and what function it has. So my question is: What does the latest studies tell us about female ejaculation?

<p>According to an author of <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/089793380X" rel="nofollow">a book on female orgasms</a>, it's similar to male ejaculate, except of course without sperm:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Female ejaculate, like male ejaculate, is prostatic fluid, mixed with some glucose and trace amounts of urine, minus the sperm," says Deborah Sundahl, author of Female Ejaculation and the G-Spot: Not Your Mother's Orgasm Book! (Hunter House Publishers).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quote taken from <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=17205" rel="nofollow">a Savage Love column</a> on the subject. As far as I can tell, Sundahl's work is substantially more authoritative than Wikipedia at this point.</p>

<p>As for function, I don't know, but I'd keep in mind that there doesn't have to be an answer; it could simply be mirroring male physiology. (Why do men have nipples?)</p>

<p>Well, according to wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_ejaculation#Nature_of_fluid" rel="nofollow">it's not urine</a>. </p>

<p>Unfortunatly, mainly due to a poor scientific corpus, exact nature of emitted fluid is yet unknown.</p>
