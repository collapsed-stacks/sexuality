Circumcision is a common practice in many countries in the world, but it is mostly performed due to social and cultural reasons (religious tradition, "wanting the boy to look like his father", etc.).

What are some other reasons one might choose to be circumcised, or have their child undergo the procedure?  
What are some of the drawbacks one needs to consider before undergoing the procedure?

Outside of religious/cultural reasons or treating specific medical conditions (phimosis or paraphimosis where alternative options haven't worked) I'm not aware of any medical benefits to circumcision.

Potential drawbacks of the procedure that I'm aware of include a "tight" circumcision that makes a full erection painful, and eventually a decrease in sensitivity (the body becomes accustomed to friction on the glans and "ignores" the sensation).  
Additionally if the procedure is performed as an adult the healing time is longer (or maybe it just feels longer as both intercourse and masturbation are not options while the penis is healing).

For more comprehensive information you may want to speak to a doctor.
