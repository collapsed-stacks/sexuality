I've been with women who I could tell shaved hair off their nipples.  Apart from being mildly  amusing, is this normal?

Short answer: Yes. 

Longer answer: On humans, hair grows everywhere except the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, on the lips and on eyelids.

Androgenic hair (ie the thick hair that is common on male chests) may or may not be present on women, depending largely on genetic disposition and hormones (so in particular drugs like the contraceptive pill may make a difference). In general, it won't be as thick as on men, as one of the primary triggers for it growing is testosterone and related hormones, but it's presence, even in fairly large quantities, is certainly not abnormal.

As ever, if it causes problems, or rapidly changes, a trip to your doctor may be a good idea.
