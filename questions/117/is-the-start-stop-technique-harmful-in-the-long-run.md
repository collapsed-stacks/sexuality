The start-stop technique relies on squeezing or putting pressure on the head of the penis to stop or delay the ejaculation. Does this pressure harm the sensitivity of one's penis in the long run?

No - penises are actually more durable than people think. Unless you are actually compressing it in a mechanical vice for extended periods of time you are unlikely to do any sort of damage to your sensitivity with your own hand.

There are theories that huge quantities (and I mean HUGE) can lead to decreased "sensitivity", but that's more likely to be getting bored with your own attentions.
