I've seen advice not to bother with certain STD tests if you're not in a risk group, or if you haven't observed certain symptoms. 

Getting a "clean bill of health" sounds reassuring, even if you're not in a risk group. What tests should that include?

HIV seems like an obvious one, for example.

Most decent STD clinics will test you for everything.
If in doubt, ask them what services they provide.

If you are in the UK, NHS direct are good people to call - http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/
If anyone has the equivalents for other countries and can post below, that would be great.

The key thing is about *when* you get tested, some STDs have an incubation period, so you might need a couple of tests over a period of time.

Remember - tell them the truth about your sexual history.

I would also recommend getting a heptatitis vaccine, especially if you are going to engage in heavy play involving cutting etc.
