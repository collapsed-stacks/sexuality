Folks,

I have major issues with premature ejaculation *and* not being able to get an erection very often.  I know much of the latter is due to my psych medications -- and, sorry, suppressing bipolar is more important than my sex drive.  One of the best solutions to premature ejaculation is of course doing it more often, but that's an issue given the other problem :(

What else can I do to last longer than a minute? :(  She'd *really* appreciate it!

<p>According to <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00926239608405302">this study</a>, Kegel exercises have been shown to help reduce premature ejaculation in men. For a lighter read and more general information on Kegel exercises, checkout the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise">Kegel exercise wikipedia article</a>, (from which I obtained the link to the study given above), specifically the section on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise#Sexual_function">sexual function</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Kurtis' advice there are some other options that come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a condom can reduce the sensation of friction, and may help delay orgasm.</li>
<li>Most condom manufacturers produce at least one line of condoms with an anaesthetic lubricant (Trojan's are called <a href="http://www.trojancondoms.com/Product/trojan-extended-pleasure-condoms-with-climax-control-lubricant.aspx">Extended Pleasure</a> with "climax control" lubricant)</li>
<li>You can speak to your doctor about a topical anaesthetic. 
(Note that if you go this route you may want to wear a condom over the anaesthetic to prevent numbing your partner and delaying <em>her</em> climax as well)</li>
</ul>

Although i'm no professional expert, intercourse isn't the only way to give your companion pleasure. From my personal experience, vibrators for her clitoris can do wonders, and you can penetrate her meanwhile she uses the vibrator to stimulate her clitoris. Also, try slowing down your rythm and/or end coitus before you ejaculate, calm down, repeat.

You can also try to invert the equation here: stimulate her so hard, she will come to climax faster than you.
