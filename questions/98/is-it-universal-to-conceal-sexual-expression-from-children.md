Imagine the following situation: mom and dad are snuggling on the sofa. The kids are playing with toys in the same room. The parental snuggling escalates, and Mom ends up giving Dad a hand job. This would absolutely be taboo in my culture.

Obviously, it's taboo if this act of sexual expression **includes** the kids ("incest"). Further, it's taboo if the act is a **display, or performance** for the children as audience. I'm pretty sure that such taboos are universal across all human cultures.

That's not what I'm asking about.

I'm asking about the situation where the adults are engaging in what would otherwise be a normal, acceptable sexual activity, with the exception that it is not explicitly hidden from the kids' view. This is taboo in my culture, but I wonder if that taboo is universal.

Are there any cultures where sexual acts are not actively concealed from children? Is there any information documenting why it is or is not acceptable to perform sexual acts in the presence of children?

<p>The short answer: No, it is not universal to "conceal" sexual expression from children. In some cultures, the physical realities of the living space more or less prevent that from being possible.</p>

<p><em><strong>However</em></strong>, "not concealing" is different from "flaunting" or "not even trying to hide". As an anthropologist by training, the best example I can think of off the top of my head is from the book <em><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0674004329">Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman</a></em> by Marjorie Shostak. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Shostak">Shosta</a>k is a well-known, well-respect American anthropologist who did a lot of ethnographic research on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/!Kung_San">!Kung</a> people of Africa's Kalahari Desert. She interviewed !Kung women about many, many things, including sex and sexuality:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Miraculously, it seemed, Bau talked freely about things I had wanted to hear, but hadn't, until then. We talked seven times over a period of two weeks; I took notes on all that I understood. She explained how children eventually became aware of their parents' sexual intercourse - <strong>conducted discreetly at night in the same one-room hut</strong>. That was how children got their ideas for sexual play. At first they played that way with friends and sometimes even with their brothers or sisters. As they grew older, they stopped playing with their siblings and played only with children of the opposite sex. She herself had played "house" when she was a child, and she remembered a time when two playmates had been discovered having "sex" under the blankets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(from Nisa introduction, p. 17, emphasis mine).</p>

<p>As with all anthropology, this is not infallible evidence. Shostak herself notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Winning Bau's trust had been the first step; trying to understand what her confidences meant came next. I knew enough not to assume that what she told me was necessarily true. Informants often told anthropologists what they thought they wanted to hear. Some even told outright lies - from concealment, from indifference, or just for amusement. It was also possible that the way Bau talked was governed by cultural forms I didn't know, but which she assumed I understood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(ibid.)</p>

<p>But Bau's stories, coupled with other interviews, the abundant free time children have and her own observations about the type of play that !Kung children engage in, led Shostak to believe that the believe that much of this process of sexual discovery are true for most !Kung people.</p>

<p>Methodological difficulties aside, this points to the conclusion that yes, there are some cultures where sex isn't totally hidden from children. Adults can be discreet about it, but it is assumed a natural part of a child's development that he or she will notice sexual acts being conducted by their parents. Arranging private meetings in which to engage in sexual acts is not very easy, so they try to be as discreet as can and don't seem to worry much about what they can't really control (e.g., a child pretending to be asleep but secretly watching).</p>

<p>This is just one example that I recalled off the top of my head; there may be others, but one example is enough to dispel any claim of "universality."</p>

<p>(Note: The above quotes come from the introduction; there's actually a whole chapter called "Discovering Sex" that's worth a read.)</p>

This can have multiple views, so I will start by analyzing the pros and cons of each, and what could happen if their are put to extremes.

**Hide from children**

This side, arguments that exposing children to sex is a negligence of parenting, because children should be protected. So the advantages of this:

 - You can control when your children start to make those types of questions;
 - Your children will probably be less obsessed with it and are unlikely to go to some paths that you deem as bad;
 - You will always look pristine to your children (in the sense that if they learn anything it will not be from you, whether this is bad or not is other question);
 - You will prevent your children from telling something that you do not want them to tell to others (it's horrible when someone knows about your sex life, because of what your children told them).

Now the disadvantages of this:

 - It will be much harder to protect your children, if they are contacted by a pedophile, since they will fell that they cannot tell anyone about what is happening to them;
 - Your children will still learn about it, but from some other source, and it might not be what you are expecting;
 - Your children might start to view you as a straighten parent, and talk to others about they doubts (if this is good or not depends of you, but you may start hearing rumors from other neighbors or friends about the questions your children make...)
 - Your children may still want to try it (in this case is like they say, the forbidden fruit is always the most wanted).
  
**Do not hide from children**

This side, arguments that sex being a human feeling should be treated as such (and draws a lot from naturism). So the advantages:

 - You will not hide anything from your children;
 - Your children will see they parents as exactly how they are;
 - You will avoid some questions (like where does babies come from?);

And the disadvantages:

 - Your children might see you as different from other parents, and create a shelf between the children they are to you and the children they are to others;
 - Your children might start to tell to others what they know, and neighbors might start to look differently at you;
 - Your children may considerer the topic to be normal stuff, and drag others to it (particularly the ones that look for the forbidden fruit);
 - Your children may start to explore some things that might not be so good for them, or they may be more receptive to pedos.

**Conclusion**

The conclusion of this is that it depends of what you think of it, and most parents are realizing that a middle ground between those two extremes (one where parents are available to answer questions in a objective way while not exposing their love life) is ideal, and that it is enough to keep them from doing something dangerous while getting them to stay informed about it.

As a final side note, like all things, children may think differently from their parents, so that a children raised on a traditional family may grow to be a more modern adult, and a adult raised on a more "untraditional" family may grow to be a more traditional adult.
