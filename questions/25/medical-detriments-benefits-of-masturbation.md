We've all heard the old wives tale that if you masturbate too much, you'll go blind. But in all seriousness, are there any medical detriments to masturbation (either short term or long term)? On the flip side, are there any medical benefits? When I say medical, I mean both from a physical and psychological perspective.

<p>Benefits of masturbation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stress and sexual tension relief</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10333355?dopt=Abstract">Is an enjoyable activity, so it produces dopamine in the brain</a></li>
<li>Lowering testosterone level</li>
<li><a href="http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/10/2200.abstract?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;volume=12&amp;firstpage=2200&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT">Helps boost the immune system</a></li>

There seems to be some connection between frequent masturbation in males between 20-30 and prostate cancer ([Source](http://www.livescience.com/7658-masturbation-increase-risk-prostate-cancer.html)). But from my reading of the articles about it, the connection could as well be that high sex-drive and a high risk for prostate cancer is the more relevant connection.

As for the positive effects you have a lot of "feel-good hormones" going through your body during orgasm which can help with stress and tensions. For men using "edging" (that is stimulating until close to orgasm, backing off and then repeating) is also said to help increase sexual stamina and endurance during sex, I do not know if this could also help females with premature-orgasms.

Also for both male and females, masturbation can help a lot when it comes to knowing ones own body and being comfortable with it.

<p>From a psychological view, this depends whether or not it becomes frequent or something you can control or not.</p>

<p>If you can not control it, then it becomes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_addiction" rel="nofollow">sexual addition</a>, and as such the detriments are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lower self-esteem;</li>
<li>Isolation;</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, this <a href="http://allpsych.com/journal/sexaddiction.html" rel="nofollow">article</a>, this <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/what-is-sexual-addiction/" rel="nofollow">one</a> and this <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_addiction/article.htm" rel="nofollow">one</a> have a lot more of detriments...</p>

<p>If it is not a addition, then by being a sexual activity, the brain releases dopamine, which causes a feeling of satisfaction and pleasure, associated with sex and as such it may make one more happy, but just because it is a sexual activity (this is a very powerful but, because any kind of sexual activity causes the same thing)<a href="http://www.reuniting.info/science/sex_in_the_brain" rel="nofollow">This link has more info</a>.</p>

<p>And that's the view on the psychological side of it.</p>
