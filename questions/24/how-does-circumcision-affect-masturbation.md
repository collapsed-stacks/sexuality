Are there any techniques of male masturbation one can't perform as well or at all after being circumcised? This would include techniques that require the so called "gliding mechanism" of the foreskin for example.

<p>I can't answer this directly as I have been circumcised almost my entire life, but it's worth noting that circumcision became popular in the United States <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_male_circumcision#Male_circumcision_to_prevent_masturbation" rel="nofollow">specifically to curb masturbation</a> in boys:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the 19th century […] Both opponents and supporters of circumcision agreed that the
  significant role the foreskin played in sexual response was the main
  reason why it should be either left in place or removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of people will tell you that there is no difference, but unless they were circumcised later in life and can actually compare based on experience, I wouldn't take it at face value as they could be rationalizing the procedure—nobody wants to admit they're in any way lacking in the sex department; <a href="http://www.nocircpa.org/4642.html" rel="nofollow">misconceptions</a> about it being "just a flap of skin" also support this. Physiologically, <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/circumcision1.htm" rel="nofollow">the evidence</a> points to a loss of sensation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those nerves packed into the foreskin provide additional stimulation
  during sexual activities. Its lubricating function also assists in
  sexual intercourse. Additionally, the frenulum (which is removed in
  some circumcisions) provides stimulation. Since the glans is kept
  moist and soft by the foreskin, it too is more sensitive to touch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, gliding and moisture can be simulated, but you can't simulate the nerve bundles and blood cells that would otherwise reside there.</p>

I've been circumcised when I was 20 years old, so I can tell you that I had the experience of masturbation with and without the frenulum. 
As Hugh said you lose some sensation because of the lack of nerves in frenulum, noneless the core of sensation is in the penis head so you won't feel numb at all. 
The "gliding" depends also of how elastic is your skin, some people need lubrication because it's hard to glide when your skin tends to be tight. In my case, I don't feel of needing lubrication or feeling numbness at all.

<p>Nope. You said yourself: the only technique which can't be performed is gliding the foreskin. But that can be replaced by any kind of moisturizer. It won't be the exact same but there is no pleasure lost as long as it's wet enough. In fact, even with the foreskin intact, it's often much better to do it with liquids anyway.</p>

<p>Other than that, there are ways to <em>masturbate</em> in which <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/1378">circumcision</a> brings no difference at all, such as hand pressing and pulsing the base, rubbing only the glans against something, not to mention if you have a partner...</p>

<p>And maybe it's good to remember ways in which even the penis doesn't play, such as body massage (yes, men can in fact ejaculate only from that), handling the testicles/scrotum, <a href="http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/questions/7/why-is-anal-sex-pleasurable">anal stimulation</a>, etc.</p>
