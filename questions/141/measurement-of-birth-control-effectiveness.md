It's possible to find failure rates for essentially all birth control methods (Wikipedia has a nice [comparison page][1]). They're defined as the probability of pregnancy during the first year of use. Sources generally seem to say that the probability is for "typical" couples. What does that mean? Is it actually just a mean or median over the sample? Are there any good resources which include some indication of amount of sexual activity corresponding to the given failure rate, so that couples can better know their *actual* risk?
