The world has come a long way since the "rhythm method", and while artificial birth control (ABC &mdash; includes drugs, barriers, and IUDs) is far more common, there are a good number of people who practice natural family planning (<abbr>NFP</abbr>), a practice which is rooted in periodic abstinence instead of introducing some external ABC. Many of these claim to be over 97% effective. (Some claim parity with ABC techniques).

I have heard of an NFP technique which was simple, highly effective, and would be incredibly accurate immediately (as opposed to a month of charting as with Billings). Does such a thing exist? (And what is a good resource on it?)
