Are there any reversible contraceptive treatments commercially available for men? (E.g. a male version of the pill, or the implant?)

This seems to have been the topic of quite a lot of interest (the [Wikipedia page on Male Contraceptives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_contraceptive) cites that *hemp seeds* was used for this purpose as early as 40 CE) and the same page lists a number of "Methods in Development" -- yet there seems to be *no* products or treatments commercially available anywhere.

Tell me I'm missing something.

<p>The literature I picked up from Planned Parenthood suggests that only physical methods are available at this time for male temporary birth control, such as condoms, withdrawl, and "outercourse". <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/mens-sexual-health/birth-control-men-22600.htm" rel="nofollow">Web source</a></p>
