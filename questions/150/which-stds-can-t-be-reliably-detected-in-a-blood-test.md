Before a couple decides to fluid bond, they may decide to get tested for a variety of sexually transmitted diseases. It would be nice to be able to show a "clean bill of health".

However, I read that blood tests don't detect genital herpes reliably. What other STDs have this limitation?

HIV in the early stages is not detected by standard blood tests. It takes a few weeks after infection before it can be detected, it's one of the reasons regular STD checks are recommended.
