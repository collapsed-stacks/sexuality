<p><a href="http://www.epigee.org/guide/pill_sex.html">This article</a> explains what a study on birth control pill on female's libido has found. In short:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]his study finds that women using the birth control pill showed markedly-decreased levels of sexual desire than those women who do not use the birth control pill. It also found that women who had discontinued use of the pill continued to suffer side effects in the long-term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, birth control pills decrease the libido, even after the female stops taking the pill.</p>

<p>One recommendation for females mentioned in the article is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are finding that you are experiencing the effects of a low libido, you may want to speak to your health care provider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is probably the wisest thing to do with most if not all such problems.</p>
