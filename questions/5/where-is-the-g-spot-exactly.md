It's a reality. Everyone or almost everyone in his adult life will hear repeatedly of the so called **G-spot**. But I haven't yet known where it is in a reliable manner.

Can someone answer with something more specific? Are there any tips/techniques for finding and/or stimulating it?

<h2>Where does the female G-Spot lie?</h2>

<p>When inserting your finger(s), feeling upwards; you can feel a bulb around two inches in. On the image below, under the point (4) points to; you see a bulb which starts one inch in and stops around three inch in.</p>

<p>This is pretty common, here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Spot" rel="nofollow">what Wikipedia has to say</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The G-Spot (4) is reportedly located one to three inches into the vagina, at the side of the urethra (6) and the urinary bladder (2).</p>

</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.askmen.com/dating/vanessa_100/115_love_secrets.html" rel="nofollow">This article</a> describes how to find it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First of all, the G-spot is easiest to locate when a woman is sexually aroused, so don't stint on your foreplay first. (You knew I would get that in!)</p>
  
  <p>To locate and master the woman's G-spot, face your partner while she is lying on her back and insert your index or long middle finger into her vagina as far as it will easily go. Then crook it up toward yourself in a "come hither" motion, sliding your fingertip along the top of the vagina until you find an area that is rougher than the rest of that vaginal wall. (Make sure you have your fingernails clipped short and buffed before you do this -- sharp fingernails will definitely spoil the effort.) This rough or slightly ridged area is the "G-spot," and touching it will often cause a woman to react with surprise or pleasure.</p>

<h2>Where does the male G-Spot lie?</h2>

<p>While everyone hears about the female G-Spot. Males have also something that is not medically called a G-Spot, but does actually result in very similar experiences like even being able to reach full body orgasms.</p>

<p>Guess what? It's the Prostate. Given the controversy, I leave <a href="http://www.askmen.com/dating/vanessa/23_love_secrets.html" rel="nofollow">reading the details</a> up to the reader. This was also mentioned in <a href="http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/a/9/145">this answer</a>, the comments guide on locating it. It's very similar to the female G-spot...</p>

<p>And for those looking to be convinced, <a href="http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/questions/7/why-is-anal-sex-pleasurable">there is also this question</a>. Your mileage may vary, though.</p>

Wikipedia has both a diagram and a description on its [G-Spot article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Spot).

The general guideline is to insert one or two fingers into the vagina, with the pads of your fingers towards the pubic bone. Bend your fingers slightly and make a "come hither" type motion. The G-spot is normally about half an inch to an inch wide, roughly circular, and has a distinct texture.

As noted in the above Wikipedia article, and plenty of other places, there's a lot of disagreement about whether the G-spot exists. I can only advocate trying and seeing if it works for you!

The G-spot is located on the front wall of the vagina about a half to one finger-length inside. Easiest way to reach it is being face to face and sticking a finger inside the vagina making a come-hither motion with your finger, when the person is very aroused it will be a small area that feels rough or bumpy and have a slight spongy feel to it. What stimulation is appreciated varies and it is in no way a magical button for all persons with vaginas. Regardless of what Wikipedia says all medical professionals I've personally spoken to agree that it exists.
