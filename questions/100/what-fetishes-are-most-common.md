I know that there are a potentially infinite number of fetishes out there, but I am curious to see if there are any studies that have been done to explore which fetishes are the most common, even if just within a target population. Especially if it explores potential differences between genders, ages, etc. Are there any studies that have looked at this?

The top twenty fetishes on Fetlife - a posting board for perverts with many thousands of kinky members lists:

1. Bondage      
2. Oral Sex      
3. Spanking       
4. Hair Pulling       
5. Anal Sex       
6. Blindfolds       
7. Biting       
8. Collar and Lead/Leash       
9. Discipline       
10. Handcuffs         
11. Talking Dirty        
12. Candle Wax         
13. Lingerie         
14. Masturbation         
15. Master/Slave         
16. Toys       
17. Ass Play         
18. Erotic Photography         
19. Breast/Nipple Torture      
20. Dildos

Now, bear in mind that "fetish" is often conflated with "stuff I'm into" rather than the traditional meaning of the word whereby a generally considered non-sexual thing is fetishised into having sexual value.

<p>According to this article in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_fetishism" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a>, feet fetish is the most common fetish. </p>

<p>As a sidenote remember that fetishism is still considered an taboo theme in current society, so studies in this area tend to be only available as part of thesis or academic papers in psychology. And some kinds of fetishism, may also be not covered in any study, so the data available might not be faithful to reality.</p>
