I have tried a couple of time, but i didn't seem to work too well.  How should one perform oral on a woman to ensure that it's satisfying?

Every one is different, which is why every one likes slightly different things done to them.  Not only is every woman is different, but the same woman can have different preferences from one session to another.

Some techniques I've found that tend to work:

 - Use the mouth/tongue to stimulate her clitoris.  Swirl around, and if you can curl your tongue so it forms a tube from front-to-back, do that and put her clit inside the curl (once she's been warmed up and is feeling good already, don't lead off with this technique, because it will overstimulate).
 - If she is so inclined and your hands are clean and you don't have long, sharp nails; then sometimes inserting a finger to play with the G-spot is also fun for the woman.

Pay attention for signals that she's having a good time.  

 - Moaning is occasional and usually right at orgasm.  Porn movies tend to have women start to scream in "ecstasy" as soon as he looks in her direction.  As the comedian once said, "Yeah... that's in the movies." 
 - As she nears orgasm, there will be body twitches, in my experience usually head and arms, but sometimes the legs will also. 
 - Be on the lookout for building tension.  When my wife is nearing orgasm, she gets quiet.  and her torso starts to tense up.
 - Held breath.  I don't understand it, but I've seen more than 1 woman hold their breath for a few seconds right before orgasm, usually with a sharp intake of air before doing so, and repeating until after the orgasm
 - The infamous head grab.  Happened to me a few times.  Very rare.  Apparently I was on a good spot but moving off of it, and the grab was to hold my head right where it felt good.

Some things to look out for:

 - Target vision.  I understand combat pilots use this term to describe someone who starts shooting at the bad guy and ends up flying into the ground/other plane.  Here, be aware that if you do the exact same thing for too long, that part of her will start to become desensitized to that type of friction.  Mix it up.
 - Don't do it if you are rushed for time.  You may not be trying to short-change it, but you will still be and she won't enjoy it.  If you only have time for a quickie, then do a quickie and leave the head for another day.
 - Dirty hands inside her.  She tends to get UTIs much easier than he does.  wash your hands right before starting.
 - stubble.  If you are a guy, feel your beard with the back of your hand.  If you want that sensation rubbing around your penis, then you are either masochistic or have a soft-enough beard to give oral.  I have a full beard, and find that I can't/shouldn't for a few days after even trimming it (since the hairs are sharp once again).
 - sharp nails.  I have the luxury of a long term relationship that has settled into when I have a good idea when sex will be happening.  As a result I'll trim my nails a day or two ahead of time.

There is no one correct way, some people prefer different teqniques. As with most physical skills the best way to learn is by doing. Have a practice with your partner and ask for honest feedback on what works and what doesn't. (I'm sure she won't mind you trying :) )

Make sure it doesn't smell bad down there. If so, talk it over with your partner.

Once you have a clean and fragrant *garden*, you can just do anything to your heart's content and everything will please her.

Remember smoother, softer, slower, and wetter strokes are better.

As with all these things, everyone likes something slightly different. More pressure here, slower, faster, whatever.

Your best way to do what your partner wants is to pay attention to them, their movements, their sounds etc., and talk with them to ask what they like.

<p>If you want to do some "academic" research before going down on your partner, <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0446690902" rel="nofollow">this book</a> will give you a few useful tips. A friend of mine wanted to learn the art of oral sex and I can tell you from personal experience that the tips are quite good... ;)</p>
