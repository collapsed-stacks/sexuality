When I have asked friends this some have suggested that it is because transgendered males have an easier time blending in and looking like younger cis-males but I have heard about statistics that show that something like only 1/5 or 1/4 request for genital reconstruction surgery is by transgendered men.

Is there any accepted explanation for this?

There is very, very, very little research available about transgender people. Statistics about transgenderism are very difficult to come by. In the United States, this is due in part to the fact that the census [does not specifically count trans people](http://transequality.org/Resources/Census0309.pdf). I would be interested to discover where you got the 20-25% statistic you cite in your question. 

It's also important to remember that not all trans people seek sex reassignment surgery. Statistics about sex reassignment surgery do not accurately mirror statistics about transgenderism in general. [This article](http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Transgender-Local-statistics-2342390.php) contains some statistics that were collected from a medical center in Albany. Note that only 31% of transwomen and 64% of transmen (in this particular, very limited, very poorly documented, very not-to-be-trusted survey sample) sought any form of surgery, including procedures for both primary and secondary sex characteristics.

[This fact sheet](http://www.transgenderlaw.org/resources/transfactsheet.pdf) cites resources from the late 90s, but it states that "Over time, the gap between the reported numbers of
MTFs and FTMs transsexuals is closing".

(Sidebar: Though they are used in the fact sheet above, the terms `MTF` and `FTM` are descriptors for trans people that are outdated and disrespectful. `MAAB` and `FAAB` [Male or Female Assigned At Birth] are preferable; see [this article](http://tranarchism.com/2010/11/26/not-your-moms-trans-101/) for details on why.)

The lack of available research makes it difficult to answer your question adequately, but this might help.
