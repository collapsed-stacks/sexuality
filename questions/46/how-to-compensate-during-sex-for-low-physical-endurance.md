Many sex acts can be physically demanding. If one partner is out of shape, they may become exhausted before both partners are fully satisfied. 

What are some techniques for helping these couples accommodate their limitations?

(Let us ignore regular aerobic exercise to increase physical endurance, as that isn't an accommodation for current physical condition, but a way to adjust that condition. And maybe sex is their aerobic exercise of choice.)

The best technique I can think of is variety: In any kind of physically demanding sexual activity there are usually two (or more) people involved, and it is not always necessary for one partner to be "doing all the work".

As an example, assuming basic missionary position the partner "on top" will be doing the majority of the physical activity.  If that partner begins to tire changing positions to allow the other partner to "ride" them will allow a rest, and give the other partner an opportunity to take a more active role.  (Note that from experience I can tell you that coordinating such position shifts may require some practice!)

Another option in the Variety toolbox is switching up the activity: Cuddling, heavy petting, (mutual) masturbation and oral sex can offer a break from the higher-intensity physical activity while retaining the intimacy and contact associated with sex.  

Additional activity options are available if one or more of the participants are agreeable to the use of toys: Conventional activities tend to involve core and leg muscles more so than the upper body, and those muscle groups can get a rest while pleasuring your partner with a dildo or masturbation sleeve.
