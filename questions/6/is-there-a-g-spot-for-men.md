The question title says it all. 

Is there a G-Spot in men? If there is, where?

I have not heard anything about this, so it is merely personal conjecture. But I don't think am the only one asking this question.

<p>I'm not sure there's a direct equivalent, but two options spring immediately to mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_massage">prostate stimulation</a>. Mechanically think about the "bend over and grab the table" part of your physical, obviously with more of an erotic overtone than a clinical one.  This can be combined (or replaced) with external stimulation as well by pressing/rubbing on the perineum ("taint") under/behind the scrotum. (Note that finding the "right" place to press/rub here might be as difficult as locating the female G-Spot, particularly if you opt for the anal route rather than the external one - It will take some practice, and may cause some discomfort until you know what you're doing so be careful/gentle!)</p></li>
<li><p>The other is that the underside of the glans tends to be extremely sensitive on most men, particularly to light touch.  It can be pleasurable for some people, though I know others who become hyper-stimulated and overly sensitive, which makes it more uncomfortable than enjoyable.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course whether or not either of these is something your partner will enjoy is something you'll have to work out for yourselves.</p>
