Please give answers for HIV and/or other STD. I do understand that it depends on the risk groups (e.g. unprotected sex, males vs females, prostitution, homosexual sex, etc) so please provide as detailed information as possible. A lot of information on the web, literature, from GPs and sexual health clinics is contradicting each other.

<p>6 months seems to be a consensus standard, and it's the one I apply (though I'm not sure about medical evidence).</p>

<p>Certain tests (like common HIV Antibody tests) have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test#Window_period">"window period"</a> where the test results may show a false negative, and a semi-annual test cycle cuts the time that you could be living with that false negative (and potentially putting partners at risk) in half when compared to an annual testing cycle.</p>

<hr>

<p>On a personal note, I have a few other testing checkpoints that I apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any time something happens that exposes me to additional risk of infection<br>
(including any events "outside the bedroom")</li>
<li>Any time I have any question about the STI/STD status of a partner.</li>
<li>When entering into what will be a long-term relationship<br>
(and I ask the same of my partner).  </li>
<li>When a committed relationship ends.</li>
</ul>

I don't think there is any hard rule about when and what to get tested for. In general I've found that talking with my doctor and other trusted sources about I go for no less then 6 months with out being tested.

I do have other factors I take in to account, such as the style of my relationships. If they are monogamous I'm more willing to go longer between tests if I'm sure my partner is being honest with me. If I'm in a non-exclusive relationship I test more often, and if anything seems out of place "down there" on either me or my partner(s) I get tested right away and talk with my Doctor.
