Synthetic condoms such as Lifestyles SKYN or Trojan Supra are a great option for people with latex allergies seeking to practice safer sex.

Are there other advantages to these newer synthetic condoms, such as improved sensation or the ability to carry one in your wallet (which has been shown to degrade and weaken latex condoms)?

Synthetic condoms have the following properties:

 - Because the material is softer, it has a natural feel and allows for more heat transfer.

 - Due to the more soft, natural, warmer feel; you get an enhancement in sensation as you *feel more*.

The down side of these satisfying properties, is that they are [slightly less efficient than latex condoms](http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/a/91/145).
