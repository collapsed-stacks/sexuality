I don't mean immediately afterwards but within a short time frame. I'm referring to both males and females regarding this biological phenomenon. What causes it and why?

It depends on how full your bladder was before you start, as well as its size. The act of ejaculating involves some muscles that squeeze the bladder, this makes urine build up and gives you the feeling like you have to go urinate because your bladder was under pressure. Luckily, most men can't urinate during erection...

When it comes to men, it is a way for the body to clean out the sperms that wasn't ejected in to the female. So it is perfectly natural to need to urinate after sex.

In females, urination shortly following coitus can prevent urinary infections by flushing away any foreign substances or bacteria that may have been introduced into the area by sexual activity. For that reason it's a commonly encouraged practice in folk wisdom as a measure against "honeymoon syndrome" aka cystitis.
