Since long ago sodomy has been practiced in many parts of the world. And many enjoy it, but is there a basis for this kind of pleasure? 

Is it a physical or psychological reaction. Physical as in the sexual organs or psychological as in behavior?

Both genders (in same-gender and non relationships) practice it as a successful form of coitus.

Can someone explain the source of this kind of pleasure?

The anal opening contains a lot of different nerve-endings which, when stimulated, can be pleasurable. Then there is also the G-spot and prostate that, depending on sex can be stimulated from anal penetration, prostate because it's basically the easiest way to reach the prostate through the rectum and the G-spot because there is a only a very thin membrane between the rectum and the vagina.

Of course there is also the psychological sensation attributed to it which probably is what attracts most heterosexuals to it since it is both taboo and can be a way of expressing dominance/submission.
