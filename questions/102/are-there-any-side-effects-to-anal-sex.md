<p>Wikipedia covers health risks well (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex#Health_risks). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anal sex can expose participants to two principal dangers: infections
  due to the high number of infectious microorganisms not found
  elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and the rectum
  due to their fragility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taking it slow, latex barriers (condoms), generous lube, and short, filed fingernails all help.</p>

<p>The sphincters are muscles. If you stretch them too fast they can get very sore. Again, take it slow and use plenty of lube.</p>

<p>With a woman, use a condom in each orifice, and change condoms when changing play. If you engage in analingus ("rimming"), you are at risk of infection orally. A dental dam can work as a latex barrier here.</p>

<p>If you're considering having anal sex, do more research. Good resources include Tristan Taormino's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1573442216">book</a> and <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000V99H18">video</a>. Review these materials with your partner. Discuss concerns. Take it slow. Don't count on things going well the first time.</p>

<p>Unprotected anal sex between a man and a woman could still produce a pregnancy, although it's unlikely. Don't count it as a way to enjoy sex without contraception.</p>

<p>A bowel movement after anal sex may be affected. Having time &amp; access to a toilet and shower after sex is nice.</p>

Anal muscles are the same as any other. The more you use them the stronger they get not weaker. Anal sex done correctly has no negative side effects. The scare stories about anal sex causing loosening are unsubstantiated.

It is worth noting howerver that there is a higher chance of STD transmission with anal sex compared to vaginal. Condoms are a must unless it's with a long term STD tested partner. (I would apply exactly the same advice to vaginal sex)

Remember that some anal lubricant can be oil based which will degrade condoms. You can buy "extra safe" condoms which are good for anal sex, they tend to be thicker and have more lubricant.

Dildoes, plugs, fingers and lots of lube (I know folk have said it, but it's worth saying again. Lube! LUBE!) and - in the case of female partners - vaginal sex beforehand all help with the preparation and make the sex more enjoyable, as can a pillow underneath the hips to get the angle right.

It's worth thinking about the non-physical side effects too - obviously gain active consent, but be aware that anal sex, as with any new sexual practice might make you feel a bit more "droppy" than usual. In my experience this is especially true for boys on their first time as it can be a very intense sensation - you may need to ask to stop, have a rest, a cup of tea and a nice chat. Reminding your partner to breathe is also important, to avoid unwanted clenching. It's a powerful sensation, there are a lot of nerve endings there.

The point about using a new condom when moving from anal to vaginal play holds true for toys, fingers and anything else you intend to put inside someone - having some anti-bacterial wipes to hand is useful.
