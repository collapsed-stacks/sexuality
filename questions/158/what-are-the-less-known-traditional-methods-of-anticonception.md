Anticonception has been around for a long time. Currently there are a number of methods available that are based on drugs, timing of sexual encounters etc... What are the less common methods of anticonception that have been historically used and are in some form effective?

An ex-boyfriend of mine used to belong to one of those military branches that don't officially exist. He wouldn't let me near his huge binder with recipes of natural poisons but I did manage to get an abortion recipe from his other binder with herbal remedies. Two of my girlfriends have tested it and found it effective. However, I'm not posting it here. Send me an email if you're interested.
