If your not sure if your question belongs, you can always ask on the meta site for clarification.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Explicit Language</strong><br>\nPlease refrain from using profane or gratuitous language to describe body parts, sexual acts, or conduct. It takes away from the professional scope of this site. Using clinical and anatomical terminology is less likely to be construed as too gratuitous.</li>\n<li><strong>Explicit Imagery</strong><br>\nAvoid posting or linking to photographs or video of sexual acts or nudity. In cases where visuals are essential to the discussion, a simple illustration or artwork can be informative without becoming gratuitous. Copyright laws apply.</li>\n<li><strong>No Vanity Images or Stories</strong><br>\nPlease do not post images or stories that depict identifiable people. If you choose to be identified on this site (i.e. not anonymous), please do not identify other people in your posts through the use of names, relationships, or other personal references.</li>\n<li><strong>External Links</strong><br>\nRefrain from using links to sexually explicit content found elsewhere. Links to external content rarely constitutes a good answer, anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, <strong>let's not spend endless, exhaustive hours <em>\"testing the fence\"</em></strong> and debating in the hypothetical about what will (and will not) be acceptable here.

If you have a topic you would like to ask about in good faith, you can always \"ask how to ask\" here in meta. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To attract experts, you need a site where people are asking very interesting and challenging questions, not the basic questions found on every other Q&amp;A site.

I've included both my specific answer and some more general discussion. In the interests of good discussion on meta, I've made it fairly strong; please don't take that as a sign I don't welcome reasoned disagreement!</p>\n\n<p>Anything which a person considers sexual and does as part of their sex life is certainly sexual for them. That, in my mind, definitively establishes it as on-topic for this site. From what I understand, this means that <strong>chastity devices, autoerotic asphyxiation, flogging, and slave contracts are absolutely on-topic</strong>. (I have little solid knowledge of slave contracts, but quickly googling seems to indicate that in the BDSM context they are quite sexual in nature.) My impression is that <strong>bootblacking is also on topic</strong>: we wouldn't blink an eye at a question about maintaining some sort of equipment used in vanilla sex.</p>\n\n<p>To pick a single example, flogging is not a part of sexuality for most people, but for some people it is. <em>Those people are the audience for a question about flogging. It doesn't matter that the topic isn't sexual for everyone; not everyone is into vanilla vaginal sex either.</em> There are many people in the world, each with their own preferences when it comes to sex. I would hate to see this site become a place where not all preferences are welcome. I understand that a fetish only enjoyed by two people in the world is probably too localized, and that's a valid reason to close a question - but that doesn't mean it was off-topic. That's an important distinction. Imagine someone is telling you why this site can't answer your question, and consider the difference between \"few people enjoy that\" and \"that's not sex\".</p>\n\n<p>In that vein, I think it's also important to realize that things can be quite uncommon and still not too localized. It's a big world, and a bit internet community; even if only 1 in 1000 is into something, that's still a lot of people. Let's be very careful about deciding that something isn't part of enough people's sex lives for it to be within the scope of this site. On StackOverflow, only about 1600 questions are tagged <code>lisp</code>, out of over 2.5 million questions. Most programmers do not ever experience lisp as part of their programming lives. There's never been any argument about whether lisp is within scope there; it's just an uncommon kind of programming. This site should take the same route, and welcome common and rare varieties and aspects of sexuality. And let's not forget: the less common things are an opportunity for the site to shine, providing good, factual answers that are currently difficult to find, online or elsewhere.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 112, "LastEditorUserId": 112, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2012-01-16T01:07:25.220", "LastActivityDate": "2012-01-16T01:07:25.220", "CommentCount": 1}

The earliest questions on a site will set the tone and topic of the site for a long time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And that tone was described as \"boring\", \"mundane\", \"vanilla.\" </p>\n\n<p>Much of this is our fault. The proposal struggled for 1-1/2 years in Area 51 and was changed several times throughout the process. We couldn't launch the earliest incarnations; and the editorial changes, while necessary, probably added a great deal of confusion and muddled the target audience for this site.</p>\n\n<p>Opening the site to a larger audience may have solved many of these problems. But the \"tone and topic\" was set early on, and we all just missed the mark. The momentum of \"wrong tone, wrong audience\" is pretty hard to overcome. To that end, if you believe the SE format or the SE culture are at odds with this subject, there are a few misconceptions we need to dispel in a second iteration:</p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #1 - Stack Exchange = One Objective Answer</h3>\n\n<p>The idea that Stack Exchange only works with <em>one-definitive-answer</em> subjects <strong>was debunked ages ago.</strong> The blog post <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/\"><strong>Good Subjective, Bad Subjective</strong></a> should be <em>required</em> reading for this site. If you can read and understand the tenets and purpose of that blog post, a future Sexuality site will do great. </p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #2 - \"Clinical Discussions\" = Professionals Only</h3>\n\n<p>When we say this site is about \"frank and clinical discussions about Sexuality\", that is to assure that questions take on an expert tone and are asked/answered in the context of professional behavior (i.e. thoughtful, intelligent discussions using the correct terminology). But somehow \"use clinical terminology\" was translated into \"browbeat users for medical and scientific studies.\" That doesn't mean the site should be allowed to fill with random conversation and tales of anecdotal <em>\"I had a friend that tried&hellip;\"</em> That's not what this site is about at all. </p>\n\n<h3>Misconception #3 - \"Notable Subjects in Sexuality\" = Vanilla</h3>\n\n<p>The scope of Sexality and the sexual experience is broad and diverse. In the entire continuum of sexuality, this site pigeon-holed into the most central, populous part of that bell curve&hellip; and then <em>wallowed</em> there relentlessly. When considering example questions, think about what type of subjects and questions would be interesting and truly provide a valuable resource to the larger community of the Internet. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 4, "LastEditorUserId": 4, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2012-01-23T17:55:25.280", "LastActivityDate": "2012-01-23T17:55:25.280"}
