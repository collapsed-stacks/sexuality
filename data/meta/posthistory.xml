There has been a lot of discussions of what would be considered &quot;appropriate content&quot; in a Stack Exchange site. The best guidance I can provide is to keep this site focused on **notable topics** in the field of &quot;Human Sexuality.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using clinical language is already the policy when discussing questions of an adult nature on other sites in our network. Use of obscene, indecent, or profane language or images is not allowed here under our [Content Policy](http://stackexchange.com/legal/content-policy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Sexually Explicit Material.** Accounts that use Stack Exchange to post sexually explicit or pornographic material, or links to it, will be suspended.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;I'm not going to try to define &quot;sexually explicit material&quot; here. This site should be conducted in the language and context you might find on any daytime TV or talk radio show&amp;hellip; but that does not make it &quot;family friendly.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Adult Audience, Mature Content&#xD;&#xA;The ideas and topics discussed here are not expected to be watered down to be consumed by an 8-year-old. We have taken reasonable measures to make sure well-meaning users do not accidentally stumble into this site without being made aware of its content. If you are not interested in seeing the topics discussed here, please refrain from using this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Inform and Educate&#xD;&#xA;The purpose of this site is to inform and educate. This is not a site for members seeking sexual partners, or to share stories of sexual encounters, or to ask questions simply to provoke a response. Language and context is important here. **Please keep questions and responses to notable topics in the field of &quot;Human Sexuality.&quot;**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This site is not here to see how far you can push this Q&amp;A format, or to test your [First Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Ammendment) rights. This site will be moderated like any other; moderated for expert content and applicability to the scope, purpose, and&amp;thinsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;frankly&amp;thinsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;how much interest your post adds to the *substance* of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**This is not a legal issue or a statement on your Internet rights; It is simply how we wish to conduct *this* site.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Content Guidelines&#xD;&#xA;To keep this site running smoothly, I can offer a few broad guidelines to help alleviate some of the questions about what might constitute &quot;appropriate content.&quot; This list is not exhaustive. If your not sure if your question belongs, you can always ask on the meta site for clarification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Explicit Language**  &#xD;&#xA;Please refrain from using profane or gratuitous language to describe body parts, sexual acts, or conduct. It takes away from the professional scope of this site. Using clinical and anatomical terminology is less likely to be construed as too gratuitous.&#xD;&#xA; - **Explicit Imagery**  &#xD;&#xA;Avoid posting or linking to photographs or video of sexual acts or nudity. In cases where visuals are essential to the discussion, a simple illustration or artwork can be informative without becoming gratuitous. Copyright laws apply.&#xD;&#xA; - **No Vanity Images or Stories**  &#xD;&#xA;Please do not post images or stories that depict identifiable people. If you choose to be identified on this site (i.e. not anonymous), please do not identify other people in your posts through the use of names, relationships, or other personal references.&#xD;&#xA; - **External Links**  &#xD;&#xA;Refrain from using links to sexually explicit content found elsewhere. Links to external content rarely constitutes a good answer, anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, **let's not spend endless, exhaustive hours *&quot;testing the fence&quot;*** and debating in the hypothetical about what will (and will not) be acceptable here. Such hypothetical arguments are exhausting and divisive. If you have a topic you would like to ask about in good faith, you can always &quot;ask how to ask&quot; here in meta. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; To attract experts, you need a site where people are asking very interesting and challenging questions, not the basic questions found on every other Q&amp;A site. Remember, the pro sites WILL attract the enthusiasts, but not the other way around!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The earliest questions on a site will set the tone and topic of the site for a long time.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*- [Asking the First Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/area-51-asking-the-first-questions/), The Stack Exchange Blog*" />

With the caveat that it's a personal experience, our lovely community moderator goes into explaining the possible responses as well as the working in detail.

However, I think the tone needs to remain academic: do not use words like &quot;clearly&quot;, &quot;obviously,&quot; or &quot;of course,&quot; and make sure to specify where you're coming from - especially if you're laying out assumptions that affect the question and the answer.

The answers are often too short and lacking support and/or any real insight. A site filled with mediocre questions will have trouble attracting (and keeping!) users and experts.  &#xD;&#xA; - **The site participation is underwhelming.** 51 questions in 7 days? 25% are closed/unanswered?

From the beginning, there has been a general perception that people were waiting in the wings for something to happen, instead of working to *make* things happen. In addition, there hasn't been enough flagging, editing or voting to close; the users aren't policing their own site enough. A passive community isn't a good community.&#xD;&#xA; - **The site has a confused identity.** The site hasn't been able to solidify who its audience is, its purpose, or gain a clear sense of self. This is, in part, due to the numerous changes it underwent during the Area 51 process. As a result, we are seeing a significant number of closed questions.

The *&quot;just using Wikipedia&quot;* community seemed way too pervasive in this site. One of the worst *sins* facing a Stack Exchange site is when it is **just not that interesting** &amp;mdash; *&quot;&amp;hellip;questions asked 100s of times on every other site on the subject.&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you read the blog post [**Asking the First Questions**](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/area-51-asking-the-first-questions/), there's a quote I often post on many up-start sites:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When put on the spot to post content, we’re likely come up with uninspired questions that anyone would ask. And they’ve all been asked 100 times before on every other site on that subject.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In these earliest days &amp;hellip; you need a site where people are asking very interesting and challenging questions, not the basic questions found on every other Q&amp;A site. The earliest questions on a site will set the tone and topic of the site for a long time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And that tone was described as &quot;boring&quot;, &quot;mundane&quot;, &quot;vanilla.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Much of this is our fault. The proposal struggled for 1-1/2 years in Area 51 and was changed several times throughout the process. We couldn't launch the earliest incarnations; and the editorial changes, while necessary, probably added a great deal of confusion and muddled the target audience for this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Opening the site to a larger audience may have solved many of these problems. But the &quot;tone and topic&quot; was set early on, and we all just missed the mark. The momentum of &quot;wrong tone, wrong audience&quot; is pretty hard to overcome. To that end, if you believe the SE format or the SE culture are at odds with this subject, there are a few misconceptions we need to dispel in a second iteration:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Misconception #1 - Stack Exchange = One Objective Answer&#xD;&#xA;The idea that Stack Exchange only works with *one-definitive-answer* subjects **was debunked ages ago.** The blog post [**Good Subjective, Bad Subjective**](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/) should be *required* reading for this site. If you can read and understand the tenets and purpose of that blog post, a future Sexuality site will do great. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Misconception #2 - &quot;Clinical Discussions&quot; = Professionals Only&#xD;&#xA;When we say this site is about &quot;frank and clinical discussions about Sexuality&quot;, that is to assure that questions take on an expert tone and are asked/answered in the context of professional behavior (i.e. thoughtful, intelligent discussions using the correct terminology). But somehow &quot;use clinical terminology&quot; was translated into &quot;browbeat users for medical and scientific studies.&quot; That doesn't mean the site would be filled with random conversation and tales of anecdotal *&quot;I had a friend that tried&amp;hellip;&quot;* That's not what this is site is about at all. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Misconception #3 - &quot;Notable Subjects in Sexuality&quot; = Vanilla&#xD;&#xA;The scope of Sexality and the sexual experience is broad and diverse.
