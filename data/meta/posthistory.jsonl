There has been a lot of discussions of what would be considered \"appropriate content\" in a Stack Exchange site. The best guidance I can provide is to keep this site focused on **notable topics** in the field of \"Human Sexuality.\"\r\n\r\nUsing clinical language is already the policy when discussing questions of an adult nature on other sites in our network. Use of obscene, indecent, or profane language or images is not allowed here under our [Content Policy](http://stackexchange.com/legal/content-policy).\r\n\r\n> **Sexually Explicit Material.** Accounts that use Stack Exchange to post sexually explicit or pornographic material, or links to it, will be suspended.\r\n \r\nI'm not going to try to define \"sexually explicit material\" here. This site should be conducted in the language and context you might find on any daytime TV or talk radio show&hellip; but that does not make it \"family friendly.\"\r\n\r\n##Adult Audience, Mature Content\r\nThe ideas and topics discussed here are not expected to be watered down to be consumed by an 8-year-old. We have taken reasonable measures to make sure well-meaning users do not accidentally stumble into this site without being made aware of its content. If you are not interested in seeing the topics discussed here, please refrain from using this site.\r\n\r\n##Inform and Educate\r\nThe purpose of this site is to inform and educate. This is not a site for members seeking sexual partners, or to share stories of sexual encounters, or to ask questions simply to provoke a response. Language and context is important here. **Please keep questions and responses to notable topics in the field of \"Human Sexuality.\"**\r\n\r\nThis site is not here to see how far you can push this Q&A format, or to test your [First Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Ammendment) rights. This site will be moderated like any other; moderated for expert content and applicability to the scope, purpose, and&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;frankly&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;how much interest your post adds to the *substance* of this site.\r\n\r\n**This is not a legal issue or a statement on your Internet rights; It is simply how we wish to conduct *this* site.**\r\n\r\n##Content Guidelines\r\nTo keep this site running smoothly, I can offer a few broad guidelines to help alleviate some of the questions about what might constitute \"appropriate content.\" This list is not exhaustive. If your not sure if your question belongs, you can always ask on the meta site for clarification.\r\n\r\n - **Explicit Language**  \r\nPlease refrain from using profane or gratuitous language to describe body parts, sexual acts, or conduct. It takes away from the professional scope of this site. Using clinical and anatomical terminology is less likely to be construed as too gratuitous.\r\n - **Explicit Imagery**  \r\nAvoid posting or linking to photographs or video of sexual acts or nudity. In cases where visuals are essential to the discussion, a simple illustration or artwork can be informative without becoming gratuitous. Copyright laws apply.\r\n - **No Vanity Images or Stories**  \r\nPlease do not post images or stories that depict identifiable people. If you choose to be identified on this site (i.e. not anonymous), please do not identify other people in your posts through the use of names, relationships, or other personal references.\r\n - **External Links**  \r\nRefrain from using links to sexually explicit content found elsewhere. Links to external content rarely constitutes a good answer, anyway.\r\n\r\nFinally, **let's not spend endless, exhaustive hours *\"testing the fence\"*** and debating in the hypothetical about what will (and will not) be acceptable here. Such hypothetical arguments are exhausting and divisive. If you have a topic you would like to ask about in good faith, you can always \"ask how to ask\" here in meta. \r\n\r\n> To attract experts, you need a site where people are asking very interesting and challenging questions, not the basic questions found on every other Q&A site. Remember, the pro sites WILL attract the enthusiasts, but not the other way around!\r\n\r\n> **The earliest questions on a site will set the tone and topic of the site for a long time.**\r\n\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*- [Asking the First Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/area-51-asking-the-first-questions/), The Stack Exchange Blog*"}

The Stack Exchange network is *all about learning*...\r\n\r\n**What about these *see-it-for-yourself* questions?**\r\n\r\nPutting that general remark aside; answers that base themselves mainly on *see-it-for-yourself* are indeed not really helpful, the individual might not be able to see it for himself or herself. It's like going out shopping for a new [insert complex electronic device], some people have no clue about what they are after.\r\n\r\nWhile we [can't recommend products](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/) or tell them what it's like, we can **give them advice** towards this. The [answer](http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/a/73/61) you mentioned does a very good job on this. With the caveat that it's a personal experience, our lovely community moderator goes into explaining the possible responses as well as the working in detail. This gives the OP a list of things he or she can look out for; which could potentially help the individual solve his or her problem, which is not influenced by too many subjective details...\r\n\r\n**What do we do about these questions?**\r\n\r\nSo, in essence, the main thing to look for is to get the question and answers to be based on advice rather than experience if it turns out to be a question that really has to be seen for oneself. This advice makes the exploration or personal experience much more satisfiable, if the individual isn't too focused on forcing it...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:**\r\n\r\nWhen you encounter a *see-it-for-yourself* question:\r\n\r\n - Edit the question such that it asks for useful advice, rather than useless individual experience.\r\n\r\n - Comment an answers to ask for them if they have advice, or vote to delete them.\r\n\r\nDo:\r\n\r\n - **Q: What are the common physical signs of an orgasm?**\r\n\r\n   I have a problem identifying whether my girlfriend has an orgasm, what can I do?\r\n\r\n - **A:** These are the common physical signs, here are some references that back them up. This is how an orgasm works. This is how you could attempt to discover and/or ask your girlfriend. The rest is up to you.\r\n\r\nDon't:\r\n\r\n - **Q: What does an orgasm look like?**\r\n\r\n - **A:** My girl does this. But I don't know about yours, you have to see it for yourself."}

A person's sexual orientation or preference.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the [tag:gender] subject is hard to find within sexual feelings, orientation and preference. \r\n\r\nI think we should only permit questions about gender that are somewhat related to sexuality, where as the gender affects the outcome of a sexual matter. This includes LGBT problems while excluding LGBT rights; and by problems I mean the sexuality related problems that could arise.\r\n\r\nI think [tag:gender] questions that are not about sexuality are better fit on a new Area 51 proposal about the society, perhaps a good idea to create that prposal if it doesn't already exist. Trying to get a better view on both subjects, I especially liked how Wikipedia lists Sexuality & Society side-by-side.\r\n\r\nFrom that viewpoint, I would conclude that **gender sexuality questions are welcome, society are not.**\r\n\r\n![][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/vCR0w.png"}

However, I think the tone needs to remain academic: do not use words like \"clearly\", \"obviously,\" or \"of course,\" and make sure to specify where you're coming from - especially if you're laying out assumptions that affect the question and the answer. I have an edit in queue for that question to try to make it a little more academic, and also to make the question answerable (by posing it more as \"tell me which cultures disagree with mine and what the cultural rationale might be, by providing documented ethnographies or other research\"). \r\n"}

The answers are often too short and lacking support and/or any real insight. A site filled with mediocre questions will have trouble attracting (and keeping!) users and experts.  \r\n - **The site participation is underwhelming.** 51 questions in 7 days? 25% are closed/unanswered? The numbers don't lie; this site isn't doing well. From the beginning, there has been a general perception that people were waiting in the wings for something to happen, instead of working to *make* things happen. In addition, there hasn't been enough flagging, editing or voting to close; the users aren't policing their own site enough. A passive community isn't a good community.\r\n - **The site has a confused identity.** The site hasn't been able to solidify who its audience is, its purpose, or gain a clear sense of self. This is, in part, due to the numerous changes it underwent during the Area 51 process. As a result, we are seeing a significant number of closed questions.  This is especially concerning when these issues do not get the attention they deserve here on meta.\r\n\r\n##Now what?\r\n\r\nThe site will close on **Tuesday, January 24, 2012**. We're leaving the site open until then so that you can continue to talk about the site and its successes and failures here in the meta section.\r\n\r\nAfter the site has closed, you have the option of relaunching a more focused and targeted Human Sexuality site proposal in Area 51.

But parenting seems to be doing fine in this format.\r\n\r\n###So what happened here? \r\n\r\nSimple. The *\"just using Wikipedia\"* community seemed way too pervasive in this site. One of the worst *sins* facing a Stack Exchange site is when it is **just not that interesting** &mdash; *\"&hellip;questions asked 100s of times on every other site on the subject.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you read the blog post [**Asking the First Questions**](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/area-51-asking-the-first-questions/), there's a quote I often post on many up-start sites:\r\n\r\n> When put on the spot to post content, we\u2019re likely come up with uninspired questions that anyone would ask. And they\u2019ve all been asked 100 times before on every other site on that subject.\r\n\r\n> In these earliest days &hellip; you need a site where people are asking very interesting and challenging questions, not the basic questions found on every other Q&A site. The earliest questions on a site will set the tone and topic of the site for a long time.\r\n\r\nAnd that tone was described as \"boring\", \"mundane\", \"vanilla.\" \r\n\r\nMuch of this is our fault. The proposal struggled for 1-1/2 years in Area 51 and was changed several times throughout the process. We couldn't launch the earliest incarnations; and the editorial changes, while necessary, probably added a great deal of confusion and muddled the target audience for this site.\r\n\r\nOpening the site to a larger audience may have solved many of these problems. But the \"tone and topic\" was set early on, and we all just missed the mark. The momentum of \"wrong tone, wrong audience\" is pretty hard to overcome. To that end, if you believe the SE format or the SE culture are at odds with this subject, there are a few misconceptions we need to dispel in a second iteration:\r\n\r\n###Misconception #1 - Stack Exchange = One Objective Answer\r\nThe idea that Stack Exchange only works with *one-definitive-answer* subjects **was debunked ages ago.** The blog post [**Good Subjective, Bad Subjective**](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/) should be *required* reading for this site. If you can read and understand the tenets and purpose of that blog post, a future Sexuality site will do great. \r\n\r\n###Misconception #2 - \"Clinical Discussions\" = Professionals Only\r\nWhen we say this site is about \"frank and clinical discussions about Sexuality\", that is to assure that questions take on an expert tone and are asked/answered in the context of professional behavior (i.e. thoughtful, intelligent discussions using the correct terminology). But somehow \"use clinical terminology\" was translated into \"browbeat users for medical and scientific studies.\" That doesn't mean the site would be filled with random conversation and tales of anecdotal *\"I had a friend that tried&hellip;\"* That's not what this is site is about at all. \r\n\r\n###Misconception #3 - \"Notable Subjects in Sexuality\" = Vanilla\r\nThe scope of Sexality and the sexual experience is broad and diverse. In the entire continuum of sexuality, this site pigeon-holed into the most central, populous part of that bell curve&hellip; and then *wallowed* there relentlessly. When considering example questions, think about what type of subjects and questions would be interesting and truly provide a valuable resource to the larger community of the Internet. "}
