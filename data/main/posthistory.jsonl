Depending on practice it will get easier\r\n - Your anal sphincters are muscles, and much like any muscle in the body they can be trained, and can be overstretched or abused.\r\n - Patience is key, take your time, it's not a race or a contest. Make sure the person who is inserting whatever into your anus also understands this. It's OK to stop and start.\r\n - Relax. One of your two anal sphincters is involuntary, so you need to subconsciously allow yourself to submit to the penetration. If you're uptight, or worried, or convinced it's gonna hurt then it will, so just let things happen, and take it easy. Take all the time you need.\r\n - Try focussing on breathing, it will clear your mind and you'll stop worrying so much on what's happening down there. Exhale when things go in.\r\n - Try to become more aware of what your anal muscles are doing, maybe perform some visualisation exercises\r\n - If it hurts whilst penetrating, hold it there, don't try to push it out.\r\n - Practice makes perfect\r\n\r\nAnd finally and most importantly:\r\n\r\n - It's OK to not be a bottom, there is no social norm that say you have to be one, some people just naturally can't cope with things up there. Maybe you're just one of them."}

Different condoms can feel different, so gather empirical data (in the obvious way). For men that orgasm sooner than they would like, common advice is to use a condom to reduce sensation. Don't assume this means that sex with a condom is always less enjoyable than sex without.\r\n\r\nA great deal of the experience of sex is psychological. If you're really excited to be engaging in this sex, you'll probably orgasm sooner, regardless of condom. If the idea of \"barebacking\" is exciting to you, wearing a condom may be disappointing, but if the idea of unprotected sex is scary, because risk of STD or pregnancy, wearing a condom can increase enjoyment. Some people associate condom use with \"cheating\" which may add to the excitement. This is all very specific to the people involved and the exact context, so there is no universal answer.\r\n\r\nFor a female partner during vaginal intercourse, a condom can change the way things feel in a way that may be significant, and possibly less pleasurable. (I assume this is also true for anal sex, but I don't have the data on hand). This is also highly personal. Since the texture of latex is different than the texture of a penis, ease of penetration can be affected; the use of a lubricant can compensate.\r\n\r\nIt bears repeating that certain lubricants are not appropriate for use with a condom, notably petroleum jelly (Vaseline) and other oil-based lubricants.\r\n\r\nIn some people, the delicate genital tissues can react badly to the latex in most condoms, from a minor decrease in pleasure to a significant allergic reaction. For these people, a non-latex condom can be a good choice.\r\n"}

I used to have a friend who swore that natural condoms felt quite a lot better, though I never found that to be the case.

Different condoms can feel different, so gather empirical data (in the obvious way). For men that orgasm sooner than they would like, common advice is to use a condom to reduce sensation. Don't assume this means that sex with a condom is always less enjoyable than sex without.\r\n\r\nA great deal of the experience of sex is psychological. If you're really excited to be engaging in this sex, you'll probably orgasm sooner, regardless of condom. If the idea of \"barebacking\" is exciting to you, wearing a condom may be disappointing, but if the idea of unprotected sex is scary, because risk of STD or pregnancy, wearing a condom can increase enjoyment. Some people associate condom use with \"cheating\" which may add to the excitement. This is all very specific to the people involved and the exact context, so there is no universal answer.\r\n\r\nFor a female partner during vaginal intercourse, a condom can change the way things feel in a way that may be significant, and possibly less pleasurable. (I assume this is also true for anal sex, but I don't have the data on hand). This is also highly personal. Since the texture of latex is different than the texture of a penis, ease of penetration can be affected; the use of a lubricant can compensate.\r\n\r\nIt bears repeating that certain lubricants are not appropriate for use with a latex condom, notably petroleum jelly (Vaseline) and other oil-based lubricants.\r\n\r\nIn some people, the delicate genital tissues can react badly to the latex in most condoms, from a minor decrease in pleasure to a significant allergic reaction. For those with latex allergies, a non-latex condom can be a good choice.\r\n"}

This can be combined (or replaced) with external stimulation as well by pressing/rubbing on the perineum (\"taint\") under/behind the scrotum. (Note that finding the \"right\" place to press/rub here might be as difficult as locating the female G-Spot, particularly if you opt for the anal route rather than the external one - It will take some practice, and may cause some discomfort until you know what you're doing so be careful/gentle!)\r\n\r\n2. The other is that the underside of the glans tends to be extremely sensitive on most men, particularly to light touch.

My theory is as follows:\r\n\r\nNeurodiversity is over-represented, compared to rest of society, in most kinds of fandom because it is often a culture where knowledge is higher valued than social skills. Along with neurodiversity and acceptance you get the higher number of HBT-persons in those fandoms. This I think is not special for furry fandom, what is special about furry fandom is that it is a fandom that is by a, not insignificant, number of the followers sexualized and people who accept one \"abnormal\" side of their sexuality is more likely to have several ways they diverge from the projected norm of society."}

If you have / could have access to multiple partners or female friends who aren't particularly shy, feel free to ask them what their reactions constitute. Otherwise, this is something that you and your partner should communicate about, as it will lead to a more positive experience for *both of you* long term. \r\n\r\nAs you mentioned, there are a *lot* of potential responses in women to indicate an orgasm. There are also a number of factors that can affect the visibility and \"obviousness\" of these responses as well. I'll do my best to be thorough. \r\n\r\nThe most common response (that is also difficult to \"fake,\" if that's what you're asking) is the flexing and the extension of the pelvic floor muscles. Women who regularly perform [Kegel exercises][1] will have longer and more intense orgasms, and their Kegel muscles will flex more rapidly and with more strength. Duration of an orgasm is affected by how much foreplay over what kind of time, as well:\r\n\r\n> **Q: My orgasms seem too short. Is there a way to make them last longer?**\r\n\r\n> A: According to our experts, yes. Try doing some trusty Kegels, those pelvic-floor exercises that work the muscles that control your urine flow. \u201cA few times a day, do both long holds for 10 to 20 seconds and short rhythmic squeezes\u2014as many as you can to give your orgasm more comic-book pow!\u201d say Miller and Solot. A longer buildup to climax can help make yours last longer too. \u201cRather than rushing from zero to 60,\u201d say Miller and Solot, \u201cget yourself close, then back off a bit. You can repeat this 10 times if you have the patience! By building up the tension, you earn yourself a bigger release.\u201d\r\n\r\n(Above from [Glamour Magazine][6].)\r\n\r\nThe flexing of pelvic floor muscles is probably the most universal reaction. Partners can feel this either, if they are male, around the shaft of the penis or around fingers during manual stimulation. \r\n\r\nSince an [orgasm][2] results in the release of [oxytocin][3] and [prolactin][4], a lot of women will sigh deeply following an orgasm, and their entire bodies will relax fully. Many women experience hypersensitivity in the [refractory period][5] following an orgasm, which is a common response to overstimulation. Basically, this feels like every nerve ending is tingling, all over one's body. In this period, stimluating the clitoris is actually actively uncomfortable, however maintaining firm pressure on the clitoris can extend the orgasm further and prepare the body for a next iteration. If she does maintain a hypersensitivity period, running a hand along legs, her torso, across and under (eg. where the wire of her bra would run) her breasts, inside forearms (especially if she spends lots of time at a keyboard!) and at the juncture of her neck and collarbone will be stimulating without being overwhelming.\r\n\r\nA number of women will have a number of muscles tense or spasm in the buildup to an orgasm. Most common are legs bending at the knees (some women will do this to help angle their partner further into the vagina) or toes curling. Depending on how aroused and how intense the oncoming orgasm is, her back may arch as well. This may be combined with a full body shudder or undulation, the latter of which will basically be her back arching and continuing into her rolling her hips. \r\n\r\nOther have mentioned other fairly common physical reactions, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n - Flushed skin (especially about the sternum and breasts, face, and neck)\r\n - Erect nipples\r\n - Darkened areolae (usually tied with flushed skin)\r\n - Goosebumps\r\n - Elevated heart rate\r\n - Increased respiration\r\n - Sudden vaginal excretion (originating from the [Bartholin glands][7], as well as the cervix)\r\n - Swelled vulva\r\n \r\nHowever, a number of these indicate arousal as much as orgasm. Furthermore, depending on the amount of exertion that she has engaged in during intercourse, as well as if she's having multiple orgasms, these could be signs of strenouous physical activity. A full, complete list of female phyiscal response during orgasm is meticulously documented in Chapter 15: Physiology of Sexual Response and Orgasm of Alfred Kinsey's [*Sexual Behavior in the Human Female*][8]. \r\n\r\nNotably, women who are relaxed about engaging in sexual intercourse are most likely to experience orgasm:\r\n\r\n> Many women believe they should have an orgasm\u2014or better yet, several\u2014every time they have sex. But if you're too busy chasing or counting them, you'll miss out on all of the pleasurable sensations in between. I had one patient who'd never had an orgasm and had spent years trying. But when she learned to relax and just enjoy the sensations she did experience, guess what happened? She climaxed.\r\n\r\n(From [Glamour Magazine][9].)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, while the clitoris is a cluster of nerve endings, the most concentrated \"knot\" of nerves is located slightly above and to the left of the clitoris itself. To use a metaphor, if one were to overlay a clock centered on the clitoris, this \"knot\" is located roughly between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock. Stimulation of this during foreplay and/or intercourse can yield a stronger reaction in the female partner. \r\n\r\nAlso, because the clitoris is a cluster of nerves, other avenues can be used to prolong, stimulate, intensify, or extend an orgasm. Many women like the feeling of pressure on her *mons* along with clitoral stimulation, as the nerve runs up through the *mons*. \r\n\r\nQuestions about how vocal a female partner will be about. This, as with everything else, is entirely dependent on the partner herself. Some women [react very vocally][12] and, ah, with gusto. However, [most women are quieter][13], either due to socialization (many cultures impose an ideal of women being quiet and submissive in all aspects) or just by nature. (I'd like to point out that the [same variation occurs in men][14]; some are louder throughout the experience, some quieter but communicative physically, etc.) Generally speaking, the release of oxytocin and prolactin will yield a very deep sigh or groan accompanied by a total body relaxtion, almost to the point of her turning into a deadweight. (And, if your partner *is* loud, perhaps consider [taking advantage of it][11].)\r\n\r\nUltimately, if you aren't sure if your partner is having an orgasm, suggest she masturbate in front of you. This will offer multiple benefits: \r\n\r\n - **You'll learn what she likes.** When engaging in autoeroticism, she'll touch herself in ways that (presumably) bring her the most pleasure. Gauge how much pressure she likes, how much clitorial stimulation, if she strokes her vulva, breasts, inner thighs, etc. \r\n - **Voyeurism is often a turn-on.** Encouraging your partner to masturbate in front of you might encourage her to come out of her shell more, if she's shy or circumspect, or even simply less experienced. Many people have a voyeurism/exhibitionist fetish that they either don't know about or haven't had the opportunity to act on. You could use the opportunity to mix in other play (self-denial, mutual masturbation, having the observing party bound and unable to particpate, etc) into the experience.\r\n - **You'll be able to observe her orgasm.** Perhaps most important, you'll be able to observe her physical reaction to orgasm, from arousal to afterglow. You can observe how she reacts as she approaches orgasm, what she does to extend the sensation, and observe how sensitive she is following. \r\n\r\nOf course, offer to masturbate for your female partner, as well, especially if she's less experienced or a newer partner.\r\n\r\nFinally, as a point of interest, the [Guardian reported recently][10] that the female orgasm had been captured in a series of brain scans.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm\r\n  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin\r\n  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin\r\n  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory_period_(sex)\r\n  [6]: http://www.glamour.com/sex-love-life/2008/04/orgasm-questions#ixzz1jGWW5rko\r\n  [7]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholin_glands\r\n  [8]: http://books.google.com/books?id=9GpBB61LV14C\r\n  [9]: http://www.glamour.com/sex-love-life/2006/07/orgasms#ixzz1jH22BNU2\r\n  [10]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/nov/14/female-orgasm-recorded-brain-scans\r\n  [11]: http://xkcd.com/316/\r\n  [12]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImmodestOrgasm\r\n  [13]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheModestOrgasm\r\n  [14]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGruntingOrgasm"}

That can induce a heart attack, with obvious potentially lethal consequences.\r\n\r\nSome of the risk will vary depending on the power of the TENS unit you're using. A low power unit has much lower risk of doing any damage than a high power one; if you're just buying a cheap off-the-shelf unit, it's not going to be very high power. That doesn't mean you can be reckless with it, however.\r\n\r\nThe common guideline I've heard is the one you mention: nothing above the waist. That said, the leaflet that came with my TENS machine recommended a variety of pad positions on the back for treating certain kinds of back pain; I assume this still has a low risk provided you don't also attach contacts to the front of the torso. The rules for [Kink.com shoots](http://www.kink.com/k/shooting_rules.jsp) additionally allow \"Nipple Clamps where the nipple completes the circuit (electricity passes on through the nipple, not from breast to breast or breast to other area of the body)\".\r\n\r\nAnother rule I've not seen repeated very often but makes sense to me is to avoid using two people to complete a circuit, for example don't have one contact near the penis and the other near the vagina for vaginal intercourse: unless you're otherwise covered in rubber, there's a risk you could, for example, touch your partner's face or torso, and suddenly there's a path for current to travel across both partners' hearts.\r\n\r\nWikipedia has [some more safety guidelines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation#Safety), which I'd summarize as keeping contacts away from the head and the spine."}

So, without even requiring voice, music will make you more satisfied. During sexual intercourse, this dopamine response thus results in extra enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAnother reason, besides dopamin, is that music helps you off-set your thoughts from thoughts that have a negative effect towards your relation; you don't want to be thinking about the problems in your life. Given the right choices that put your thoughts on the actual sexual intercourse, without being uncomfortable can surely help.

A group of students was asked to take a pause of 10 minutes and then listed to music in 30 minute intervals. After each interval, they captured the saliva to be used in the measurement. The notable result of this study is that the the testerone levels of males significantly decreased where-as the testerone levels of females significantly increased, remarkable is those that listened to silence had nearly the same testerone levels before and after.

What one person might mean when they describe themselves using certain words will very likely differ from what another person means while using the same descriptors. \r\n\r\nThat said, people who have undergone some or all of the process of transitioning between genders will generally describe themselves with words that refer to the gender they present - that is, the gender that is not necessarily the one they were assigned at birth. \r\n\r\nFor example: a heterosexual transman is a man who was assigned as female at birth who is romantically and/or sexually attracted to women; a gay transman is attracted to men. A gay transwoman is a lesbian; a heterosexual transwoman's attractions are to men. \r\n\r\nThere will always be exceptions to this rule, as with any rule, but I think it is a good place to start.\r\n\r\nThe table in your question has a cell indicating that 12% of transmen identify as lesbian. This goes against what I know of the trans community, but it could possibly be explained depending on when during the transition process the survey information was taken. Sometimes heterosexual transmen identify as lesbians before they transition. (Sometimes they don't. I cannot stress enough: everyone is different. No rule or statement will apply to everyone.)\r\n\r\nAt any rate: I disagree with the information in the table, or at the very least I don't understand what they are getting at. In my experience it's very infrequent to find a transman who also identifies as a lesbian - the two identities are sort of at odds. (A person who identifies in both of these ways could possibly consider themself bigender or genderqueer. They could also consider themself a lesbian transman if that's what they felt.)\r\n\r\nThe long and the short of it is that there are no rules that govern who gets to use what words to describe themselves. It's always a matter of personal choice.\r\n\r\n"}

Depending on practice it will get easier\r\n - Your anal sphincters are muscles, and much like any muscle in the body they can be trained, and can be overstretched or abused.\r\n - Patience is key, take your time, it's not a race or a contest. Make sure the person who is inserting whatever into your anus also understands this. It's OK to stop and start.\r\n - Relax. One of your two anal sphincters is involuntary, so you need to subconsciously allow yourself to submit to the penetration. If you're uptight, or worried, or convinced it's gonna hurt then it will, so just let things happen, and take it easy. Take all the time you need.\r\n - Try focussing on breathing, it will clear your mind and you'll stop worrying so much on what's happening down there. Exhale when things go in.\r\n - Try to become more aware of what your anal muscles are doing, maybe perform some visualisation exercises\r\n - If it hurts whilst penetrating, hold it there, don't try to push it out.\r\n - Practice makes perfect\r\n\r\nAnd finally and most importantly:\r\n\r\n - It's OK to not be a bottom, there is no social norm that say you have to be one, some people just naturally can't cope with things up there.

Avoid separate non-water-based lubricants.\r\n\r\nLatex condoms are known for their elastic properties, its tensile strength exceeds 30 MPa and may be stretched to 800% before breaking (from Wikipedia which references [this PubMed article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12264044). There are even [standardized ISO requirements and test methods](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:6N527TCAVD4J:211.67.52.20:8088/xitong/BZ%255C9429065.pdf+&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESim74fVBDeWAPIWTFd_2ngNUTYyQPKMB3ab7nGOyMJhOEvejgoOwVTFxJoJGYaSubhSa8yW-UUnaPU1US03QQw9R6o5FvKAiZGVeMRb6QJ3UTyobrI3EzQEfyPruvImR8kRFxMd&sig=AHIEtbSrmLZZze1juoVSZqSwNbxStfvssA) to ensure that every latex condom meets the minimum necessary to be effective. They test latex condoms for holes with an electrical current, only packaging it when it passes. In addition, a portion of each batch of condoms is tested for water leak and air burst.\r\n\r\nHowever, Latex condoms can be affected by [certain types of lubricants](http://www.walnet.org/csis/med_research/oilstudy.html) that affect the latex. Also note that some people are also allergic for Latex and thus can't use these type of condoms, although synthetic latex condoms exist to work around these issues. An example condom is [SKYN](http://condomunity.com/polyisoprene-skyn-lifestyles-condoms/2008/11/21/), which is known well to be useful for those with allergy; another reason [listed by their site](http://www.lifestyles.com/products/skyn/) is that it goes for better sensitivity. It however does not list anything about the effectiveness.\r\n\r\nA comparison between latex and synthetic rubbers been made and listed in a contraception report, if the Wayback Machine allows it you can read about it [on this WayBack link](http://web.archive.org/web/20060926035226/http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243). A lot of articles I found suddenly seem to lose their existance, either because the site is rewritten or the site ceased to exist. As the site is currently offline, I can't tell you the exact results. Although the link is being referred to as that non-Latex condoms are not affected by certain types of lubricants of which Latex condoms are affected.\r\n\r\nThe same report however tells us that that these condoms can be stretched less and are thus more likely to break. Here is a response that mentions how polyurethane condoms aren't strectchy, with the caveat that the difference is small if used properly:\r\n\r\n> Polyurethane is a plastic and stronger than latex, but not quite as stretchy. For that reason, polyurethane condoms are slightly more likely to break or slip. However, this performance difference is small and does not have much of an effect on the condom's overall efficacy.\r\n\r\n> &mdash; [Alice - Do polyurethane condoms protects well against STIs?](http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/do-polyurethane-condoms-protect-well-against-stis-latex)\r\n\r\nPolyisophrene condoms on the other hand, share the quality of latex and non-allergic condoms together.\r\n\r\nSo, as a conclusion latex gets the preference but you really shouldn't be worrying. You can however switch to synthetic condoms like SKYN when you really look for the need to have a more natural feeling or when you have an allergic problem. When using latex condoms, watch out with lubricants as they can affect the condom; this is not seen with synthetic condoms.

So the advantages of this:\r\n\r\n - You can control when your children start to make those types of questions;\r\n - Your children will probably be less obsessed with it and are unlikely to go to some paths that you deem as bad;\r\n - You will always look pristine to your children (in the sense that if they learn anything it will not be from you, whether this is bad or not is other question);\r\n - You will prevent your children from telling something that you do not want them to tell to others (it's horrible when someone knows about your sex life, because of what your children told them).\r\n\r\nNow the disadvantages of this:\r\n\r\n - It will be much harder to protect your children, if they are contacted by a pedophile, since they will fell that they cannot tell anyone about what is happening to them;\r\n - Your children will still learn about it, but from some other source, and it might not be what you are expecting;\r\n - Your children might start to view you as a straighten parent, and talk to others about they doubts (if this is good or not depends of you, but you may start hearing rumors from other neighbors or friends about the questions your children make...)\r\n - Your children may still want to try it (in this case is like they say, the forbidden fruit is always the most wanted).\r\n  \r\n**Do not hide from children**\r\n\r\nThis side, arguments that sex being a human feeling should be treated as such (and draws a lot from naturism). So the advantages:\r\n\r\n - You will not hide anything from your children;\r\n - Your children will see they parents as exactly how they are;\r\n - You will avoid some questions (like where does babies come from?);\r\n\r\nAnd the disadvantages:\r\n\r\n - Your children might see you as different from other parents, and create a shelf between the children they are to you and the children they are to others;\r\n - Your children might start to tell to others what they know, and neighbors might start to look differently at you;\r\n - Your children may considerer the topic to be normal stuff, and drag others to it (particularly the ones that look for the forbidden fruit);\r\n - Your children may start to explore some things that might not be so good for them, or they may be more receptive to pedos.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this is that it depends of what you think of it, and most parents are realizing that a middle ground between those two extremes (one where parents are available to answer questions in a objective way while not exposing their love life) is ideal, and that it is enough to keep them from doing something dangerous while getting them to stay informed about it.\r\n\r\nAs a final side note, like all things, children may think differently from their parents, so that a children raised on a traditional family may grow to be a more modern adult, and a adult raised on a more \"untraditional\" family may grow to be a more traditional adult."}

Generally the men I've come into contact with can often be worried about perceptions of \"being gay\" with respect to a number of sexual kinks, including pegging and anal fisting.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons for why men and women might have different outward attitudes to kink, and this is all very broad brush strokes, ultimately each person comes to kink / BDSM through a series of happenstances which are very much a product of their lives - it's very hard to generalise! \r\n\r\nIt's also difficult to know whether one has a kink until one knows it exists. You need to see or (better) experience something in order to know  whether you like it or not. \r\n\r\nBut, if we must, here are some broad brush strokes for you:\r\n\r\nWomen are brought up to be more sexually aware and more aware of themselves as sexualised beings (for good or for ill). For example, Ann Summers - UK high street sex shop - caters for women rather than men, the sex shops that do exist for men tend to be the more \"secretive\" and seedy porn outlets. The more open and overt a sex shop for men, the more likely it is to be for the gay market. Because women are more comfortable with their sexuality they are more likely to experiment.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, men are socially conditioned to \"take the lead\" and be more dominant - whether they are sexually dominant or not, which is another question for another time - so may seek out or initiate new types of sex in order to maintain this appearance. There is evidence that men buy more porn than women (possibly because there is more porn made for men than for women, so it's all a bit academic) and porn has increasingly shown more \"extreme\" and kinky types of sex, so men are likely to be aware of, and perhaps interest in trying it out.

You can buy \"extra safe\" condoms which are good for anal sex, they tend to be thicker and have more lubricant.\r\n\r\nDildoes, plugs, fingers and lots of lube (I know folk have said it, but it's worth saying again. Lube! LUBE!) and - in the case of female partners - vaginal sex beforehand all help with the preparation and make the sex more enjoyable, as can a pillow underneath the hips to get the angle right.\r\n\r\nIt's worth thinking about the non-physical side effects too - obviously gain active consent, but be aware that anal sex, as with any new sexual practice might make you feel a bit more \"droppy\" than usual. In my experience this is especially true for boys on their first time as it can be a very intense sensation - you may need to ask to stop, have a rest, a cup of tea and a nice chat. Reminding your partner to breathe is also important, to avoid unwanted clenching. It's a powerful sensation, there are a lot of nerve endings there.\r\n\r\nThe point about using a new condom when moving from anal to vaginal play holds true for toys, fingers and anything else you intend to put inside someone - having some anti-bacterial wipes to hand is useful."}

Not only is every woman is different, but the same woman can have different preferences from one session to another.\r\n\r\nSome techniques I've found that tend to work:\r\n\r\n - Use the mouth/tongue to stimulate her clitoris.  Swirl around, and if you can curl your tongue so it forms a tube from front-to-back, do that and put her clit inside the curl (once she's been warmed up and is feeling good already, don't lead off with this technique, because it will overstimulate).\r\n - If she is so inclined and your hands are clean and you don't have long, sharp nails; then sometimes inserting a finger to play with the G-spot is also fun for the woman.\r\n\r\nPay attention for signals that she's having a good time.  \r\n\r\n - Moaning is occasional and usually right at orgasm.  Porn movies tend to have women start to scream in \"ecstasy\" as soon as he looks in her direction.  As the comedian once said, \"Yeah... that's in the movies.\" \r\n - As she nears orgasm, there will be body twitches, in my experience usually head and arms, but sometimes the legs will also. \r\n - Be on the lookout for building tension.  When my wife is nearing orgasm, she gets quiet.  and her torso starts to tense up.\r\n - Held breath.  I don't understand it, but I've seen more than 1 woman hold their breath for a few seconds right before orgasm, usually with a sharp intake of air before doing so, and repeating until after the orgasm\r\n - The infamous head grab.  Happened to me a few times.  Very rare.  Apparently I was on a good spot but moving off of it, and the grab was to hold my head right where it felt good.\r\n\r\nSome things to look out for:\r\n\r\n - Target vision.  I understand combat pilots use this term to describe someone who starts shooting at the bad guy and ends up flying into the ground/other plane.  Here, be aware that if you do the exact same thing for too long, that part of her will start to become desensitized to that type of friction.  Mix it up.\r\n - Don't do it if you are rushed for time.  You may not be trying to short-change it, but you will still be and she won't enjoy it.  If you only have time for a quickie, then do a quickie and leave the head for another day.\r\n - Dirty hands inside her.  She tends to get UTIs much easier than he does.  wash your hands right before starting.\r\n - stubble.  If you are a guy, feel your beard with the back of your hand.  If you want that sensation rubbing around your penis, then you are either masochistic or have a soft-enough beard to give oral.  I have a full beard, and find that I can't/shouldn't for a few days after even trimming it (since the hairs are sharp once again).\r\n - sharp nails.  I have the luxury of a long term relationship that has settled into when I have a good idea when sex will be happening.  As a result I'll trim my nails a day or two ahead of time. \r\n"}

Oral sex and digital/manual sex (handjobs/fingering in layman's terms) are two options that you should consider if you haven't already, and having your spouse perform these on you (with your reciprocating when she desires it, of course!) would not require her to be sexually aroused if she is not in the mood for it, but would allow you the intimacy that comes from being with another person. Mutual masturbation can also help a relationship, and if she doesn't want to participate, you could ask her if it's alright if you do so next to her or while she's in the room.\r\n\r\nYou might also see what you can do to get her in the mood. Massage and foreplay are by no means underrated; also, learn about and utilise what you know of what turns her on and how she likes things.\r\n\r\nAnothoer option (if the previous two fail) includes sex toys. I don't want to make assumptions about your gender, since you don't say, and neither does your profile, so I will just say that they can be very useful both for solo use and with a partner, no matter how you identify. If you're female, there is a plethora of different toys available. If you're male, they're not just for cisgendered women to use; there are plenty of ways for men to stimulate themselves, too, including (but not limited to) cock rings, fleshlights, and cock sleeves, as well as various kinds of anal stimulation, which is not just for gay men, as many people believe (in fact, not all gay men enjoy anal sex at all). As a starting point, Good Vibrations (http://www.goodvibes.com) has a large number of options, and there are many other online venues available if you're interested.\r\n\r\nA third choice is to discuss a nonmongamous relationship with your spouse. I am aware that you described your relationship as monogamous, and I also stress the discussion aspect of this. If you choose this route, be honest with her; tell her the issues that you're having (although if you haven't done that yet, you definitely should!) and see if she might be open to the prospect of you attaining sexual gratification elsewhere. This is something that many couples will not consider, but it can greatly improve someone's well-being. Sex Advice columnist Dan Savage has a lot to say on this topic (he describes it as \"monogamish\"), and one of his recent columns had a number of letters from couples who benefit from it: http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=11412386. There are quite a few other columns in the archives that discuss the same issues, as well.\r\n\r\nI do hope this helps!"}

Many of these claim to be over 97% effective. (Some claim parity with ABC techniques).\r\n\r\nI have heard of an NFP technique which was simple, highly effective, and would be incredibly accurate immediately (as opposed to a month of charting as with Billings). Does such a thing exist? (And what is a good resource on it?)"}
