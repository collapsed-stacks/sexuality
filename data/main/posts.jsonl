If you have / could have access to multiple partners or female friends who aren't particularly shy, feel free to ask them what their reactions constitute. Otherwise, this is something that you and your partner should communicate about, as it will lead to a more positive experience for <em>both of you</em> long term. </p>\n\n<p>As you mentioned, there are a <em>lot</em> of potential responses in women to indicate an orgasm. There are also a number of factors that can affect the visibility and \"obviousness\" of these responses as well. I'll do my best to be thorough. </p>\n\n<p>The most common response (that is also difficult to \"fake,\" if that's what you're asking) is the flexing and the extension of the pelvic floor muscles. Women who regularly perform <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise\">Kegel exercises</a> will have longer and more intense orgasms, and their Kegel muscles will flex more rapidly and with more strength. Duration of an orgasm is affected by how much foreplay over what kind of time, as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Q: My orgasms seem too short. Is there a way to make them last longer?</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>A: According to our experts, yes. Try doing some trusty Kegels, those pelvic-floor exercises that work the muscles that control your urine flow. \u201cA few times a day, do both long holds for 10 to 20 seconds and short rhythmic squeezes\u2014as many as you can to give your orgasm more comic-book pow!\u201d say Miller and Solot. A longer buildup to climax can help make yours last longer too. \u201cRather than rushing from zero to 60,\u201d say Miller and Solot, \u201cget yourself close, then back off a bit. You can repeat this 10 times if you have the patience! By building up the tension, you earn yourself a bigger release.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Above from <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/sex-love-life/2008/04/orgasm-questions#ixzz1jGWW5rko\">Glamour Magazine</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The flexing of pelvic floor muscles is probably the most universal reaction. Partners can feel this either, if they are male, around the shaft of the penis or around fingers during manual stimulation. </p>\n\n<p>Since an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm\">orgasm</a> results in the release of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin\">oxytocin</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin\">prolactin</a>, a lot of women will sigh deeply following an orgasm, and their entire bodies will relax fully. Many women experience hypersensitivity in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory_period_%28sex%29\">refractory period</a> following an orgasm, which is a common response to overstimulation. Basically, this feels like every nerve ending is tingling, all over one's body. In this period, stimluating the clitoris is actually actively uncomfortable, however maintaining firm pressure on the clitoris can extend the orgasm further and prepare the body for a next iteration. If she does maintain a hypersensitivity period, running a hand along legs, her torso, across and under (eg. where the wire of her bra would run) her breasts, inside forearms (especially if she spends lots of time at a keyboard!) and at the juncture of her neck and collarbone will be stimulating without being overwhelming.</p>\n\n<p>A number of women will have a number of muscles tense or spasm in the buildup to an orgasm. Most common are legs bending at the knees (some women will do this to help angle their partner further into the vagina) or toes curling. Depending on how aroused and how intense the oncoming orgasm is, her back may arch as well. This may be combined with a full body shudder or undulation, the latter of which will basically be her back arching and continuing into her rolling her hips. </p>\n\n<p>Other have mentioned other fairly common physical reactions, including but not limited to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Flushed skin (especially about the sternum and breasts, face, and neck)</li>\n<li>Erect nipples</li>\n<li>Darkened areolae (usually tied with flushed skin)</li>\n<li>Goosebumps</li>\n<li>Elevated heart rate</li>\n<li>Increased respiration</li>\n<li>Sudden vaginal excretion (originating from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholin_glands\">Bartholin glands</a>, as well as the cervix)</li>\n<li>Swelled vulva</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, a number of these indicate arousal as much as orgasm. Furthermore, depending on the amount of exertion that she has engaged in during intercourse, as well as if she's having multiple orgasms, these could be signs of strenouous physical activity. A full, complete list of female phyiscal response during orgasm is meticulously documented in Chapter 15: Physiology of Sexual Response and Orgasm of Alfred Kinsey's <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=9GpBB61LV14C\"><em>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</em></a>. </p>\n\n<p>Notably, women who are relaxed about engaging in sexual intercourse are most likely to experience orgasm:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many women believe they should have an orgasm\u2014or better yet, several\u2014every time they have sex. But if you're too busy chasing or counting them, you'll miss out on all of the pleasurable sensations in between. I had one patient who'd never had an orgasm and had spent years trying. But when she learned to relax and just enjoy the sensations she did experience, guess what happened? She climaxed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(From <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/sex-love-life/2006/07/orgasms#ixzz1jH22BNU2\">Glamour Magazine</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, while the clitoris is a cluster of nerve endings, the most concentrated \"knot\" of nerves is located slightly above and to the left of the clitoris itself. To use a metaphor, if one were to overlay a clock centered on the clitoris, this \"knot\" is located roughly between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock. Stimulation of this during foreplay and/or intercourse can yield a stronger reaction in the female partner. </p>\n\n<p>Also, because the clitoris is a cluster of nerves, other avenues can be used to prolong, stimulate, intensify, or extend an orgasm. Many women like the feeling of pressure on her <em>mons</em> along with clitoral stimulation, as the nerve runs up through the <em>mons</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Questions about how vocal a female partner will be about. This, as with everything else, is entirely dependent on the partner herself. Some women <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImmodestOrgasm\">react very vocally</a> and, ah, with gusto. However, <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheModestOrgasm\">most women are quieter</a>, either due to socialization (many cultures impose an ideal of women being quiet and submissive in all aspects) or just by nature. (I'd like to point out that the <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGruntingOrgasm\">same variation occurs in men</a>; some are louder throughout the experience, some quieter but communicative physically, etc.) Generally speaking, the release of oxytocin and prolactin will yield a very deep sigh or groan accompanied by a total body relaxtion, almost to the point of her turning into a deadweight. (And, if your partner <em>is</em> loud, perhaps consider <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/316/\">taking advantage of it</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, if you aren't sure if your partner is having an orgasm, suggest she masturbate in front of you. This will offer multiple benefits: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You'll learn what she likes.</strong> When engaging in autoeroticism, she'll touch herself in ways that (presumably) bring her the most pleasure. Gauge how much pressure she likes, how much clitorial stimulation, if she strokes her vulva, breasts, inner thighs, etc. </li>\n<li><strong>Voyeurism is often a turn-on.</strong> Encouraging your partner to masturbate in front of you might encourage her to come out of her shell more, if she's shy or circumspect, or even simply less experienced. Many people have a voyeurism/exhibitionist fetish that they either don't know about or haven't had the opportunity to act on.

Given the right choices that put your thoughts on the actual sexual intercourse, without being uncomfortable can surely help. Surely avoid the radio or your personal collection, but try romantic collection albums...</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Are there other related studies? Do they have effect?</h2>\n\n<p>At the Nara University of Education in Japan, they have <a href=\"http://chialvo.org/Curso/UNR2010/Modulo%201%20Musica%20Y%20Neurociencia/Publicaciones/FUKUI.pdf\">discovered a relation between Music and Testosterone levels</a>. A group of students was asked to take a pause of 10 minutes and then listed to music in 30 minute intervals. After each interval, they captured the saliva to be used in the measurement. The notable result of this study is that the the testerone levels of males significantly decreased where-as the testerone levels of females significantly increased, remarkable is those that listened to silence had nearly the same testerone levels before and after. Some types had more influence compared to other types of music.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7AoR5.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xhli9.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sadly, while Testosterone affects development, it has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone\">barely any</a> physiological or sexual effects.</strong></p>\n\n<p>But yet I mentioned because it is an interesting read none-the-less.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 145, "LastActivityDate": "2012-01-13T03:08:08.053"}

This is observed not only in humans, but in all populations, and usually ends up looking like the following:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6S0Ku.jpg\" alt=\"Maximum Sustainable Yield: Credit Wikipedia\"></p>\n\n<p><em>Image credit Wikipedia.</em></p>\n\n<p>Now, this graph here is a very simplified theoretical graph, and, as we all know, they don't align properly to real life all the time.

You'll notice that human population really leveled out there (essentially) for thousands of years. You didn't see that combinatorial growth until the industrial revolution. Minor bumps here and there, and you see increases 2000 BC and around 0 AD but the real growth you could expect is around the industrial revolution. That is when the MSY sky rocketed. Before this time you had minor inventions which certainly helped increase the MSY, but nothing like in the industrial revolution. At that point we were able to produce enough food, shelter and other necessities to be able to sustain livelihoods in a consistent manor. This is what has allowed the population to grow now, and what prevented it from growing before. More kids meant either you or they starve. Which did happen, frequently. And that leads us to...</p>\n\n<h2>Disease and Mortality</h2>\n\n<p>Disease really starts to set in more later, but we'll cover it a bit. The industrial revolution helped <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eMBG_soDdNoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=diseases%20industrial%20revolution&amp;ots=t0IRdwIAvJ&amp;sig=VPeS4Zxt7ZAXsYJG4DHlIVi_-OY#v=onepage&amp;q=diseases%20industrial%20revolution&amp;f=false\">spread diseases amongst people faster</a> as people were now grouped together more closely. But one of the issues of being a hunter/gatherer society is needing to be on the move. And while on the move there are many things that can kill children very quickly. Animals, cold, getting lost, even eating the wrong berries. <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=1-HWKKKIhBQC&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;ots=zuaMEJt8YT&amp;dq=hunter%20gatherer%20child%20rearing&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA313#v=onepage&amp;q=hunter%20gatherer%20child%20rearing&amp;f=false\">This ebook</a>, though missing a few pages, seems to have some pretty good information about the topic. Including the following equation on page 313 pertaining to the survival chances of children in hunter/gather societies. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3qiu.png\" alt=\"Equation for child survival rate\"></p>\n\n<p>This book focuses more on the sociological aspects of their survival, but that will play into this significantly as well.</p>\n\n<p>Now for mortality and life expectancy. I was trying to not use Wikipedia as a reference if I could help it, but they actually have a really good chart on this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy#Life_expectancy_variation_over_time\">on the Life Expectancy article</a>. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NlLSU.png\" alt=\"Life Expectancy Chart\"></p>\n\n<p><em>Chart Credit Wikipedia</em></p>\n\n<p>You'll notice that, as children, there is a higher mortality rate, as indicated often by the notes (once the get to 15, they are expect to live...). And while this chart takes into account childhood mortality rate, it does not take into account pre-natal mortality rate. With advances in modern medicine, giving birth has had a much higher success rate (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr56/nvsr56_10.pdf\">source</a>).</p>\n\n<p>You'll notice in the chart, the Neolithic age has the lowest life expectancy of any other age. And this, mostly, is the age in which you are discussing. Many children born never reached sexual maturity and therefore could never produce offspring. This meant that the population never grew exponentially as you might expect if each of two or three children would have two or three children.</p>\n\n<h2>tl;dr</h2>\n\n<p>In my research for this, I did stumble across a paper that seemed to be talking directly to what your question gets at, and is actually where some of the data for the life expectancy chart comes from. <a href=\"http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Papers/2007/2007-14_paper.pdf\">The Neolithic Revolution and Contemporary Variations in Life\nExpectancy</a> by Oded Galor and Omer Moav seems to answer your question (a little side-ways since their focus is on life expectancy, but still). Specifically, on page 5, footnote 12, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As is well established in the evolutionary biology literature since\n  the seminal work of Lack [1954], the allocation of resources between\n  offspring \u2018caring\u2019 and \u2018bearing\u2019 is subjected to evolutionary changes.\n  Lack (1954) suggests that clutch sizes (e.g., number of eggs per\n  nest), among owls and other predatory vole-eating birds, for instance,\n  are positively related to food abundance. He argues that the clutch\n  size is selected such that under any feeding conditions fertility\n  rates ensure the maximal reproductive success. Furthermore, Cody\n  [1966] documents the existence of significant differences between\n  clutch sizes of the same bird species on islands and nearby mainland\n  localities of the same latitude. In temperate regions where food is\n  more abundant in the mainland than on islands, the average clutch size\n  is smaller on the islands. For instance, Cyanoramphus novaezelandeae,\n  the average mainland clutch is 6.5 whereas the average in the island\n  is 4.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is basically what I was discussing with the MSY above. I didn't get a chance to read through all of it yet, but the parts I did read seem to discuss their points with a fair bit of depth.

In some cultures, the physical realities of the living space more or less prevent that from being possible.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>However</em></strong>, \"not concealing\" is different from \"flaunting\" or \"not even trying to hide\". As an anthropologist by training, the best example I can think of off the top of my head is from the book <em><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0674004329\">Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman</a></em> by Marjorie Shostak. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Shostak\">Shosta</a>k is a well-known, well-respect American anthropologist who did a lot of ethnographic research on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/!Kung_San\">!Kung</a> people of Africa's Kalahari Desert. She interviewed !Kung women about many, many things, including sex and sexuality:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Miraculously, it seemed, Bau talked freely about things I had wanted to hear, but hadn't, until then. We talked seven times over a period of two weeks; I took notes on all that I understood. She explained how children eventually became aware of their parents' sexual intercourse - <strong>conducted discreetly at night in the same one-room hut</strong>. That was how children got their ideas for sexual play. At first they played that way with friends and sometimes even with their brothers or sisters. As they grew older, they stopped playing with their siblings and played only with children of the opposite sex. She herself had played \"house\" when she was a child, and she remembered a time when two playmates had been discovered having \"sex\" under the blankets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(from Nisa introduction, p. 17, emphasis mine).</p>\n\n<p>As with all anthropology, this is not infallible evidence. Shostak herself notes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Winning Bau's trust had been the first step; trying to understand what her confidences meant came next. I knew enough not to assume that what she told me was necessarily true. Informants often told anthropologists what they thought they wanted to hear. Some even told outright lies - from concealment, from indifference, or just for amusement. It was also possible that the way Bau talked was governed by cultural forms I didn't know, but which she assumed I understood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(ibid.)</p>\n\n<p>But Bau's stories, coupled with other interviews, the abundant free time children have and her own observations about the type of play that !Kung children engage in, led Shostak to believe that the believe that much of this process of sexual discovery are true for most !Kung people.</p>\n\n<p>Methodological difficulties aside, this points to the conclusion that yes, there are some cultures where sex isn't totally hidden from children. Adults can be discreet about it, but it is assumed a natural part of a child's development that he or she will notice sexual acts being conducted by their parents. Arranging private meetings in which to engage in sexual acts is not very easy, so they try to be as discreet as can and don't seem to worry much about what they can't really control (e.g., a child pretending to be asleep but secretly watching).</p>\n\n<p>This is just one example that I recalled off the top of my head; there may be others, but one example is enough to dispel any claim of \"universality.\"</p>\n\n<p>(Note: The above quotes come from the introduction; there's actually a whole chapter called \"Discovering Sex\" that's worth a read.)</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 43, "LastEditorUserId": 43, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2012-01-16T20:30:10.653", "LastActivityDate": "2012-01-16T20:30:10.653"}

Not only is every woman is different, but the same woman can have different preferences from one session to another.</p>\n\n<p>Some techniques I've found that tend to work:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use the mouth/tongue to stimulate her clitoris.  Swirl around, and if you can curl your tongue so it forms a tube from front-to-back, do that and put her clit inside the curl (once she's been warmed up and is feeling good already, don't lead off with this technique, because it will overstimulate).</li>\n<li>If she is so inclined and your hands are clean and you don't have long, sharp nails; then sometimes inserting a finger to play with the G-spot is also fun for the woman.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Pay attention for signals that she's having a good time.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Moaning is occasional and usually right at orgasm.  Porn movies tend to have women start to scream in \"ecstasy\" as soon as he looks in her direction.  As the comedian once said, \"Yeah... that's in the movies.\" </li>\n<li>As she nears orgasm, there will be body twitches, in my experience usually head and arms, but sometimes the legs will also. </li>\n<li>Be on the lookout for building tension.  When my wife is nearing orgasm, she gets quiet.  and her torso starts to tense up.</li>\n<li>Held breath.  I don't understand it, but I've seen more than 1 woman hold their breath for a few seconds right before orgasm, usually with a sharp intake of air before doing so, and repeating until after the orgasm</li>\n<li>The infamous head grab.  Happened to me a few times.  Very rare.  Apparently I was on a good spot but moving off of it, and the grab was to hold my head right where it felt good.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some things to look out for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Target vision.  I understand combat pilots use this term to describe someone who starts shooting at the bad guy and ends up flying into the ground/other plane.  Here, be aware that if you do the exact same thing for too long, that part of her will start to become desensitized to that type of friction.  Mix it up.</li>\n<li>Don't do it if you are rushed for time.  You may not be trying to short-change it, but you will still be and she won't enjoy it.  If you only have time for a quickie, then do a quickie and leave the head for another day.</li>\n<li>Dirty hands inside her.  She tends to get UTIs much easier than he does.  wash your hands right before starting.</li>\n<li>stubble.  If you are a guy, feel your beard with the back of your hand.  If you want that sensation rubbing around your penis, then you are either masochistic or have a soft-enough beard to give oral.  I have a full beard, and find that I can't/shouldn't for a few days after even trimming it (since the hairs are sharp once again).</li>\n<li>sharp nails.  I have the luxury of a long term relationship that has settled into when I have a good idea when sex will be happening.  As a result I'll trim my nails a day or two ahead of time. </li>\n</ul>\n", "OwnerUserId": 83, "LastActivityDate": "2012-01-22T17:35:07.183"}

Oral sex and digital/manual sex (handjobs/fingering in layman's terms) are two options that you should consider if you haven't already, and having your spouse perform these on you (with your reciprocating when she desires it, of course!) would not require her to be sexually aroused if she is not in the mood for it, but would allow you the intimacy that comes from being with another person. Mutual masturbation can also help a relationship, and if she doesn't want to participate, you could ask her if it's alright if you do so next to her or while she's in the room.</p>\n\n<p>You might also see what you can do to get her in the mood. Massage and foreplay are by no means underrated; also, learn about and utilise what you know of what turns her on and how she likes things.</p>\n\n<p>Anothoer option (if the previous two fail) includes sex toys. I don't want to make assumptions about your gender, since you don't say, and neither does your profile, so I will just say that they can be very useful both for solo use and with a partner, no matter how you identify. If you're female, there is a plethora of different toys available. If you're male, they're not just for cisgendered women to use; there are plenty of ways for men to stimulate themselves, too, including (but not limited to) cock rings, fleshlights, and cock sleeves, as well as various kinds of anal stimulation, which is not just for gay men, as many people believe (in fact, not all gay men enjoy anal sex at all). As a starting point, Good Vibrations (http://www.goodvibes.com) has a large number of options, and there are many other online venues available if you're interested.</p>\n\n<p>A third choice is to discuss a nonmongamous relationship with your spouse. I am aware that you described your relationship as monogamous, and I also stress the discussion aspect of this. If you choose this route, be honest with her; tell her the issues that you're having (although if you haven't done that yet, you definitely should!) and see if she might be open to the prospect of you attaining sexual gratification elsewhere. This is something that many couples will not consider, but it can greatly improve someone's well-being. Sex Advice columnist Dan Savage has a lot to say on this topic (he describes it as \"monogamish\"), and one of his recent columns had a number of letters from couples who benefit from it: <a href=\"http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=11412386\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=11412386</a>. There are quite a few other columns in the archives that discuss the same issues, as well.</p>\n\n<p>I do hope this helps!</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 179, "LastActivityDate": "2012-01-22T22:39:38.013"}
