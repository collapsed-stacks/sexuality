  <row Id="268" PostId="146" Text="Sorry, ofc means of-course. As I understand, although I may be wrong on my understanding of them, IUDs don't involve ingesting anything, artificial or natural and so presumably have a less objectionable effect on the body. I understood egregious as to mean you'r saying IUDs are too artificial, not natural enough, and while not ideal they must be better than unreliable approaches based on timing and better for those who prefer to avoid artificial substances such as pills for example. There may be pills made of natural substances but these would be less targeted and have more unwanted effects." CreationDate="2012-01-20T17:33:58.343" UserId="174" />
